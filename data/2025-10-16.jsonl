Code and data are available at\n  https://github.com/strongSoda/LITERAL-TO-LIBERAL", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning\nengines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid\nadherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human\ncommon sense and intent. This \"rule-rigidity\" is a significant barrier to\nbuilding trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue,\nSFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To\naddress this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a\nnovel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned\nexception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides\nthe model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks,\nclassifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final\ndecision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced\njudgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that\nthe RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human\nAlignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.\nFurthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.\nThis work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering\nLLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,\npaving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents."}

However, most existing works primarily\nfocus on automatically generating detection rules for new attacks, often\noverlooking the relationships between new attacks and existing rules, which\nleads to significant redundancy within the ever-expanding ruleset. To address\nthis issue, we propose GRIDAI, a novel end-to-end framework for the automated\nGeneration and Repair of Intrusion Detection rules through collaboration among\nmultiple LLM-based agents. Unlike traditional methods, GRIDAI first assesses\nthe nature of incoming attack samples. If the sample represents a new attack\ntype, it is used to generate a new rule. Otherwise, the sample is identified as\na variant of an attack already covered by an existing rule and used to repair\nthe rule by updating the corresponding signature, thereby enhancing its\ngeneralization capability. Additionally, to mitigate syntactic and semantic\nerrors in rules caused by LLM hallucinations, we incorporate a tool-based\nreal-time validation mechanism and a representative attack sample maintained\nfor each rule, enabling fully automated rule generation and repair.\nComprehensive experiments were conducted on a public dataset containing seven\ntypes of attacks and a private dataset with 43 attack types. The results\ndemonstrate that GRIDAI accurately identifies the relationships between new\nattack samples and existing rules, efficiently generates and repairs rules to\nhandle new attacks and variants, and effectively mitigates the impact of LLM\nhallucinations."}
