By repeatedly opening or keeping a\nDRAM row (aggressor row) open, we show that it is possible to disturb DRAM\ncells through a DRAM column (i.e., bitline) and induce bitflips in DRAM cells\nsharing the same columns as the aggressor row (across multiple DRAM subarrays).\nWith ColumnDisturb, the activation of a single row concurrently disturbs cells\nacross as many as three subarrays (e.g., 3072 rows) as opposed to\nRowHammer/RowPress, which affect only a few neighboring rows of the aggressor\nrow in a single subarray. We rigorously characterize ColumnDisturb and its\ncharacteristics under various operational conditions using 216 DDR4 and 4 HBM2\nchips from three major manufacturers. Among our 27 key experimental\nobservations, we highlight two major results and their implications.\n  First, ColumnDisturb affects chips from all three major manufacturers and\nworsens as DRAM technology scales down to smaller node sizes (e.g., the minimum\ntime to induce the first ColumnDisturb bitflip reduces by up to 5.06x). We\nobserve that, in existing DRAM chips, ColumnDisturb induces bitflips within a\nstandard DDR4 refresh window (e.g., in 63.6 ms) in multiple cells. We predict\nthat, as DRAM technology node size reduces, ColumnDisturb would worsen in\nfuture DRAM chips, likely causing many more bitflips in the standard refresh\nwindow. Second, ColumnDisturb induces bitflips in many (up to 198x) more rows\nthan retention failures. Therefore, ColumnDisturb has strong implications for\nretention-aware refresh mechanisms that leverage the heterogeneity in cell\nretention times: our detailed analyses show that ColumnDisturb greatly reduces\nthe benefits of such mechanisms."}

Our findings\nshow that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal\nrelationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.\nWhile there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality\nor merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings\nsupport the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language\nmodels in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed\ndecision-making."}

By repeatedly opening or keeping a\nDRAM row (aggressor row) open, we show that it is possible to disturb DRAM\ncells through a DRAM column (i.e., bitline) and induce bitflips in DRAM cells\nsharing the same columns as the aggressor row (across multiple DRAM subarrays).\nWith ColumnDisturb, the activation of a single row concurrently disturbs cells\nacross as many as three subarrays (e.g., 3072 rows) as opposed to\nRowHammer/RowPress, which affect only a few neighboring rows of the aggressor\nrow in a single subarray. We rigorously characterize ColumnDisturb and its\ncharacteristics under various operational conditions using 216 DDR4 and 4 HBM2\nchips from three major manufacturers. Among our 27 key experimental\nobservations, we highlight two major results and their implications.\n  First, ColumnDisturb affects chips from all three major manufacturers and\nworsens as DRAM technology scales down to smaller node sizes (e.g., the minimum\ntime to induce the first ColumnDisturb bitflip reduces by up to 5.06x). We\nobserve that, in existing DRAM chips, ColumnDisturb induces bitflips within a\nstandard DDR4 refresh window (e.g., in 63.6 ms) in multiple cells.

It emulates a\nprincipled research and development workflow through three collaborative\nphases: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning to formulate a sound\nresearch plan, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, and (3) a\nclosed-loop of autonomous evaluation and refinement in a sandboxed simulation\nenvironment. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we also introduce\nAgentFL-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 16 diverse tasks designed to assess\nthe system-level generation capabilities of agentic systems in FL. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach generates solutions competitive with,\nand often superior to, established hand-crafted baselines. Our work represents\na significant step towards the automated engineering of complex decentralized\nAI systems."}

Today's\napplications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a\nshift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as\nthe Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools\nby including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the\nprompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a\ngrowing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts\nbecome longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and\nreduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the\nprompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework\ndesigned to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large\nsets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and\nuses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools,\nbased on both the query and the taxonomy structure. In this paper, we describe\nthe design of the taxonomy, the tool selection algorithm, and the dataset used\nto evaluate JSPLIT. Our results show that JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt\nsize without significantly compromising the agent's ability to respond\neffectively. As the number of available tools for the agent grows\nsubstantially, JSPLIT even improves the tool selection accuracy of the agent,\neffectively reducing costs while simultaneously improving task success in\nhigh-complexity agent environments."}

To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a\nthree-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in\nhuman-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which\ndistinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself\n(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to\nseparate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)\nConflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested\nthrough disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation.

These limitations lead to unreliable\noutput, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly\nwhen interacting with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems such\nas codebases and documents. To address these challenges, we introduce the\nGatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs\nagent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate\nand reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity \"latent state\" representation of the\nsystem to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All\ninteractions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a\ndeclarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the\nsystem remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the\nGatekeeper Protocol for software development.

These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards,\nlow factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and\nfidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward\nnoise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured\nreasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated\nsupervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,\nproviding execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level\nvalidation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation\nmechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback.\nFinally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative\nstructure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned\nLLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples,\namounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with\nauto-labeled supervision.

In this\nwork, we show that a lesser-known geometric constraint--namely, that language\nmodel outputs lie on the surface of a high-dimensional ellipse--functions as a\nsignature for the model and can be used to identify the source model of a given\noutput. This ellipse signature has unique properties that distinguish it from\nexisting model-output association methods like language model fingerprints.
