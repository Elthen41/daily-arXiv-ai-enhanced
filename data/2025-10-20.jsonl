In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that the Ramulator 2.0 simulation results reported in the Mess\npaper are incorrect and, at the time of the publication of the Mess paper,\nirreproducible. We find that the authors of Mess paper made multiple trivial\nhuman errors in both the configuration and usage of the simulators. We show\nthat by correctly configuring Ramulator 2.0, Ramulator 2.0's simulated memory\nsystem performance actually resembles real system characteristics well, and\nthus a key claimed contribution of the Mess paper is factually incorrect. We\nalso identify that the DAMOV simulation results in the Mess paper use wrong\nsimulation statistics that are unrelated to the simulated DRAM performance.\nMoreover, the Mess paper's artifact repository lacks the necessary sources to\nfully reproduce all the Mess paper's results.\n  Our work corrects the Mess paper's errors regarding Ramulator 2.0 and\nidentifies important issues in the Mess paper's memory simulator evaluation\nmethodology. We emphasize the importance of both carefully and rigorously\nvalidating simulation results and contacting simulator authors and developers,\nin true open source spirit, to ensure these simulators are used with correct\nconfigurations and as intended. We encourage the computer architecture\ncommunity to correct the Mess paper's errors. This is necessary to prevent the\npropagation of inaccurate and misleading results, and to maintain the\nreliability of the scientific record.

We present Hive hash table, a\nhigh-performance, warp-cooperative and dynamically resizable GPU hash table\nthat adapts to varying workloads without global rehashing.\n  Hive hash table makes three key contributions. First, a cache-aligned packed\nbucket layout stores key-value pairs as 64-bit words, enabling coalesced memory\naccess and atomic updates via single-CAS operations. Second, warp-synchronous\nconcurrency protocols - Warp-Aggregated-Bitmask-Claim (WABC) and\nWarp-Cooperative Match-and-Elect (WCME) - reduce contention to one atomic\noperation per warp while ensuring lock-free progress. Third, a\nload-factor-aware dynamic resizing strategy expands or contracts capacity in\nwarp-parallel K-bucket batches using linear hashing, maintaining balanced\noccupancy. To handle insertions under heavy contention, Hive hash table employs\na four-step strategy: replace, claim-and-commit, bounded cuckoo eviction, and\noverflow-stash fallback. This design provides lock-free fast paths and bounded\nrecovery cost under contention determined by a fixed eviction depth, while\neliminating ABA hazards during concurrent updates.\n  Experimental evaluation on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 shows Hive hash table sustains\nload factors up to 95% while delivering 1.5-2x higher throughput than\nstate-of-the-art GPU hash tables (Slab-Hash, DyCuckoo, WarpCore) under mixed\ninsert-delete-lookup workloads. On balanced workload, Hive hash table reaches\n3.5 billion updates/s and nearly 4 billion lookups/s, demonstrating scalability\nand efficiency for GPU-accelerated data processing."}

Yet\nmost LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success\ncriteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving\nuncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of\nthe same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which\nLMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer\nreliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains\npoorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an\nextensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation\ntasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background\ninformation and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these\npriors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to\nsamples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we\nfind that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.\nPerformance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the\nmodel, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning\neffort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging\nevaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are\nbetter at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty."}

The system\ncomprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating\nisland agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects\n(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The\nhummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm\nfrom the Unity ML-Agents toolkit.

A key aspect of\nefficient utilization is the ability to rescale applications on the fly to\nmaximize the utilization of cloud resources. Most commonly used parallel\nprogramming models like MPI have traditionally not supported autoscaling either\nin a cloud environment or on supercomputers.

The autonomous generation of these protocols\nthrough natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the\nreproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs)\noften generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To\naddress this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of\nover 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing\nboth comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol\ngeneration, we propose the \"Sketch-and-Fill\" paradigm, which separates\nanalysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and\nverifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism\nevaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model\noptimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we\ndevelop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that\nprogresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately\nto robust, executable protocol generation.

Our\nfirst-cut controller, named beLLMan, enables the LLM infrastructure to actively\nand progressively signal the first-party LLM application to adjust the output\nlength in response to changing system load. On a real testbed with H100 GPUs,\nbeLLMan helps keep inferencing latency under control (upto 8X lower end-to-end\nlatency) and reduces energy consumption by 25% (while serving 19% more\nrequests) during periods of congestion for a summarization workload."}

However, their\nwidespread deployment has exposed critical security risks, particularly through\njailbreak prompts that can bypass model alignment and induce harmful outputs.\nDespite intense research into both attack and defense techniques, the field\nremains fragmented: definitions, threat models, and evaluation criteria vary\nwidely, impeding systematic progress and fair comparison. In this\nSystematization of Knowledge (SoK), we address these challenges by (1)\nproposing a holistic, multi-level taxonomy that organizes attacks, defenses,\nand vulnerabilities in LLM prompt security; (2) formalizing threat models and\ncost assumptions into machine-readable profiles for reproducible evaluation;\n(3) introducing an open-source evaluation toolkit for standardized, auditable\ncomparison of attacks and defenses; (4) releasing JAILBREAKDB, the largest\nannotated dataset of jailbreak and benign prompts to date; and (5) presenting a\ncomprehensive evaluation and leaderboard of state-of-the-art methods. Our work\nunifies fragmented research, provides rigorous foundations for future studies,\nand supports the development of robust, trustworthy LLMs suitable for\nhigh-stakes deployment."}
