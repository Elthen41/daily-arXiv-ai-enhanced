Using multi-source and heterogeneous IoT data aids in providing\nefficient data analytics for a variety of prevalent and crucial applications.\nTo address the privacy and security concerns raised by analyzing IoT data\nlocally or in the cloud, distributed data analytics techniques were proposed to\ncollect and analyze data in edge or fog devices. In this context, federated\nlearning has been recommended as an ideal distributed machine/deep\nlearning-based technique for edge/fog computing environments. Additionally, the\ndata analytics results are time-sensitive; they should be generated with\nminimal latency and high reliability. As a result, reusing efficient\narchitectures validated through a high number of challenging test cases would\nbe advantageous. The work proposed here presents a solution using a\nmicroservices-based architecture that allows an IoT application to be\nstructured as a collection of fine-grained, loosely coupled, and reusable\nentities. The proposed solution uses the promising capabilities of federated\nlearning to provide intelligent microservices that ensure efficient, flexible,\nand extensible data analytics. This solution aims to deliver cloud calculations\nto the edge to reduce latency and bandwidth congestion while protecting the\nprivacy of exchanged data. The proposed approach was validated through an\nIoT-malware detection and classification use case. MaleVis, a publicly\navailable dataset, was used in the experiments to analyze and validate the\nproposed approach. This dataset included more than 14,000 RGB-converted images,\ncomprising 25 malware classes and one benign class. The results showed that our\nproposed approach outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of\ndetection and classification performance, with a 99.24%."}

However, recent\nstudies have revealed that VLMs, including CLIP, are highly vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks, particularly on their visual modality. Traditional methods\nfor improving adversarial robustness, such as adversarial training, involve\nextensive retraining and can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we\npropose a new Test-Time defense: Feature Perception Threshold Counterattack\nNoise (FPT-Noise), which enhances the adversarial robustness of CLIP without\ncostly fine-tuning. Our core contributions are threefold: First, we introduce a\nDynamic Feature Modulator that dynamically generate an image-specific and\nattack-adaptive noise intensity parameter. Second, We reanalyzed the image\nfeatures of CLIP. When images are exposed to different levels of noise, clean\nimages and adversarial images exhibit distinct rates of feature change. We\nestablished a feature perception threshold to distinguish clean images from\nattacked ones. Finally, we integrate a Scene-Aware Regulation guided by a\nstability threshold and leverage Test-Time Transformation Ensembling (TTE) to\nfurther mitigate the impact of residual noise and enhance robustness.Extensive\nexperimentation has demonstrated that FPT-Noise significantly outperforms\nexisting Test-Time defense methods, boosting average robust accuracy from 0.07%\nto 56.86% under AutoAttack while maintaining high performance on clean images\n(-1.1%).

In QIF there are two main perspectives\nfor the quantification of leakage. On one hand, the static perspective\nconsiders all possible runs of the system in the computation of information\nflow, and is usually employed when preemptively deciding whether or not to run\nthe system. On the other hand, the dynamic perspective considers only a\nspecific, concrete run of the system that has been realised, while ignoring all\nother runs. The dynamic perspective is relevant for, e.g., system monitors and\ntrackers, especially when deciding whether to continue or to abort a particular\nrun based on how much leakage has occurred up to a certain point. Although the\nstatic perspective of leakage is well-developed in the literature, the dynamic\nperspective still lacks the same level of theoretical maturity. In this paper\nwe take steps towards bridging this gap with the following key contributions:\n(i) we provide a novel definition of dynamic leakage that decouples the\nadversary's belief about the secret value from a baseline distribution on\nsecrets against which the success of the attack is measured; (ii) we\ndemonstrate that our formalisation satisfies relevant information-theoretic\naxioms, including non-interference and relaxed versions of monotonicity and the\ndata-processing inequality (DPI); (iii) we identify under what kind of analysis\nstrong versions of the axioms of monotonicity and the DPI might not hold, and\nexplain the implications of this (perhaps counter-intuitive) outcome; (iv) we\nshow that our definition of dynamic leakage is compatible with the\nwell-established static perspective; and (v) we exemplify the use of our\ndefinition on the formalisation of attacks against privacy-preserving data\nreleases."}

However, there are some barriers that\nprevent the exploitation of the full potential of this technology. First, the\nmajor cloud providers currently put the onus of implementing the mechanisms\nthat ensure compliance with the desired service levels on cloud consumers.\nHowever, consumers do not have the required expertise. Since each cloud\nprovider exports a different set of low-level metrics, the strategies defined\nto ensure compliance with the established service-level agreement (SLA) are\nbound to a particular cloud provider. This fosters provider lock-in and\nprevents consumers from benefiting from the advantages of multi-cloud\nenvironments. This paper presents a solution to the problem of automatically\ntranslating SLAs into objectives expressed as metrics that can be measured\nacross multiple cloud providers.

We observe that many open-weight RLMs,\nincluding DeepSeek-R1-distilled, s1.1, Phi-4-mini-reasoning, and Nemotron,\nsuffer from self-jailbreaking despite being aware of the harmfulness of the\nrequests.

They grow a tree of self-modifications through\nexpansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark\nperformance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent\nself-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's\nself-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark\nperformance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by\nHuxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates\nthe benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of\nits potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding\nagent development setting, access to the true $\\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to\nsimulate how the G\\\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions.
