Abstract: Large-scale scientific datasets -- spanning health biobanks, cell atlases,
Earth reanalyses, and more -- create opportunities for exploratory discovery
unconstrained by specific research questions. We term this process hypothesis
hunting: the cumulative search for insight through sustained exploration across
vast and complex hypothesis spaces. To support it, we introduce AScience, a
framework modeling discovery as the interaction of agents, networks, and
evaluation norms, and implement it as ASCollab, a distributed system of
LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors. These agents
self-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing
findings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such
social dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the
diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established
biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic
targets. While wet-lab validation remains indispensable, our experiments on
cancer cohorts demonstrate that socially structured, agentic networks can
sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like
India.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks that require sustained reasoning and multiple tool
interactions remain challenging for LLM agents: small errors compound across
steps, and even state-of-the-art models often hallucinate or lose coherence. We
identify context management as the central bottleneck -- extended histories
cause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant
information, thus failing to replan or reflect from previous mistakes. To
address this, we propose COMPASS (Context-Organized Multi-Agent Planning and
Strategy System), a lightweight hierarchical framework that separates tactical
execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into three specialized
components: (1) a Main Agent that performs reasoning and tool use, (2) a
Meta-Thinker that monitors progress and issues strategic interventions, and (3)
a Context Manager that maintains concise, relevant progress briefs for
different reasoning stages. Across three challenging benchmarks -- GAIA,
BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam -- COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20%
relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. We further introduce a
test-time scaling extension that elevates performance to match established
DeepResearch agents, and a post-training pipeline that delegates context
management to smaller models for enhanced efficiency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce the Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action) framework: an evaluation
paradigm based on an agent's operational loop of setting goals, devising plans,
and executing actions. The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal
Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan
Adherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent
with its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes
in the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an
agent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's
actions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's
final outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two
benchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for
a production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a
systematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent
errors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that
exhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95%
errors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted
improvement of agent performance.

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning,
yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as
writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional
alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also
maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice:
models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer
concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where
individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The
fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism
that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic
Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic
decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model
explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs
payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself
and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During
training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative
responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In
addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic
reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM
service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially
improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to
baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large multimodal models (LMMs) often fail to capture
their performance in real-time, adversarial environments. We introduce LM Fight
Arena (Large Model Fight Arena), a novel framework that evaluates LMMs by
pitting them against each other in the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat II,
a task requiring rapid visual understanding and tactical, sequential
decision-making. In a controlled tournament, we test six leading open- and
closed-source models, where each agent operates controlling the same character
to ensure a fair comparison. The models are prompted to interpret game frames
and state data to select their next actions. Unlike static evaluations, LM
Fight Arena provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment
of an LMM's strategic reasoning capabilities in a dynamic setting. This work
introduces a challenging and engaging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI
evaluation and interactive entertainment.

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to reliable LLM evaluation,
where models may achieve high performance by memorizing training data rather
than demonstrating genuine reasoning capabilities. We introduce RADAR (Recall
vs. Reasoning Detection through Activation Representation), a novel framework
that leverages mechanistic interpretability to detect contamination by
distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based model responses. RADAR
extracts 37 features spanning surface-level confidence trajectories and deep
mechanistic properties including attention specialization, circuit dynamics,
and activation flow patterns. Using an ensemble of classifiers trained on these
features, RADAR achieves 93\% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set, with
perfect performance on clear cases and 76.7\% accuracy on challenging ambiguous
examples. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanistic interpretability
for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs). We introduce a
benchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a
pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of
information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on
particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created
dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest
textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or
more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a
nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline
hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with
open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5)
a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and
hallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly
outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics,
with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and
cross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average
agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5
Likert scale (5 indicating "strongly agree").

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to
activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop
recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an
entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG
extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a
lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to
other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue
entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search
across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit
relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without
exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the
2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG
sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from
0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate
the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex
question answering.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The deep-research framework orchestrates external tools to perform complex,
multi-step scientific reasoning that exceeds the native limits of a single
large language model. However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak
evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we
propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the
epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two
complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background
knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each
graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion
for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for
depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty,
DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and
fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The
fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a
complement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool
execution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can
reconstruct answers stably and effectively. On the scientific reasoning
benchmarks HLE and GPQA, DualResearch achieves competitive performance. Using
log files from the open-source system InternAgent, its accuracy improves by
7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they encounter numerous
challenges in terms of reasoning efficiency, such as large model size,
overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios. However,
research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking.
To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves
faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while
unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In
the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy
Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each
reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of
responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality
responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In
the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free
model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified
architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors
and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection
regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them.
Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering
mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general
capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling
lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant
challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent
benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often
fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel
plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies
fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan
quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our
evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75\%)
and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a
large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form
requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we
conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including
test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and
RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility
over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward
scores.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for
critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity
exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a
vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however,
are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails
to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language
models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for
tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this
impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR),
designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core
insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a
deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern,
creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to
generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined
architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for
rule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.
Our work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in
automated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the
state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/cdltlehf/LRR.

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

Abstract: Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software
development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced
CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs
without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests
that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows
advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus
system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs
to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with
class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage
in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted
consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle
Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and
preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on
CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving
at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini
in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to
GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final
predictions. Our code and data is available at

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque
over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling
and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the
task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,
existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in
complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise
relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in
the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise
relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy
and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above
problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification
method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to
address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with
pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the
higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the
accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction
module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced
to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic
evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the
physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure
that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive
dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the
prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain
network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper
has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social
deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on
information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of
persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses.
In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on
convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this
limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg
competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically
influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize
utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across
three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform
baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents
capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios
requiring persuasive communication.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
problem-solving tasks. Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high
computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient
inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM
between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches
often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for
the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this
work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls
the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In
particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss,
formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently
determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically,
using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes
ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our
comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method
can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public
now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most
health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly
proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical
capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings,
considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free
healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly
lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health
disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into
LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory
analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical
domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient
profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural
language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used
for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically
differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients
receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends
amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing
trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and
for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure
these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust
patient support. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: In the field of medicine and healthcare, the utilization of medical
expertise, based on medical knowledge combined with patients' health
information is a life-critical challenge for patients and health professionals.
The within-laying complexity and variety form the need for a united approach to
gather, analyze, and utilize existing knowledge of medical treatments, and
medical operations to provide the ability to present knowledge for the means of
accurate patient-driven decision-making. One way to achieve this is the fusion
of multiple knowledge sources in healthcare. It provides health professionals
the opportunity to select from multiple contextual aligned knowledge sources
which enables the support for critical decisions. This paper presents multiple
conceptual models for knowledge fusion in the field of medicine, based on a
knowledge graph structure. It will evaluate, how knowledge fusion can be
enabled and presents how to integrate various knowledge sources into the
knowledge graph for rescue operations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language
processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large
reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their
computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite
context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on
problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a
novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex)
problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin).
PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing
computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space
exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a
labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering
process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and
5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity
and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation
metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial
computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for
evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at

Abstract: This paper reviews the architecture and implementation methods of agents
powered by large language models (LLMs). Motivated by the limitations of
traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to
develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the
performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception
system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a
reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates
actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought;
a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term
mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into
concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more
capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for
autonomous and intelligent behavior.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved
through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic
anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical
proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention
provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds
on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when
group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention
mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy
and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners
to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes,
supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and
capability.

Abstract: Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in

underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level
explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then
provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the
implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the
logical inference required by the task.

Abstract: Constraint Programming (CP) offers an intuitive, declarative framework for
modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on
successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based
heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence
variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational
domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including
insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of
their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for
constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying
data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing
trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed
for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the
effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem
modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride
Problem.

Abstract: Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a
degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has
recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language
models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information,
follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a
wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated
workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit
from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex
tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already
demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information
extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation
underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where
decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources.
Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to
drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated
workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This
review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key
applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and
outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT
integration.

Abstract: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI)
applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide
abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of
the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not
realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In
addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural
approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a
gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the
symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora
has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing
GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs
from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT
and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of
abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the
first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art
benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to
baselines.
  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual
(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with
domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,
Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to
prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On
text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT
yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG
that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher
ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.
