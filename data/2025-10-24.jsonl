The\nalgorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large\nsuperpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule\nto guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --\nincorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem\nHamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is\nupdated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,\nwhich iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the\nspin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies\nglobal minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO\ninstances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku\npuzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with\nlong-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the\nalgorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving\ninstances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are deployed to\ncounter the cyberattacks. However, an IDS effectively detects attacks based on\nthe known signatures and patterns, Zero-day attacks go undetected. To overcome\nthis drawback in IDS, the integration of a Dense Neural Network (DNN) with Data\nAugmentation is proposed. It makes IDS intelligent and enables it to self-learn\nwith high accuracy when a novel attack is encountered. The network flow\ncaptures datasets are highly imbalanced same as the real network itself. The\nData Augmentation plays a crucial role in balancing the data. The balancing of\ndata is challenging as the minority class is as low as 0.000004\\% of the\ndataset, and the abundant class is higher than 80\\% of the dataset. Synthetic\nMinority Oversampling Technique is used for balancing the data. However, higher\naccuracies are achieved with balanced test data, lower accuracies are\nnoticeable with the original imbalanced test data suggesting overfitting. A\ncomparison with state-of-the-art research using Synthetic Minority Oversampling\nTechnique with Edited Nearest Neighbor shows the classification of classes\nremains poor for the original dataset. This suggests highly imbalanced datasets\nof network flow require a different method of data augmentation."}

Auto-scalers are the systems that enable this elasticity by acquiring\nand releasing resources on demand to ensure an agreed service level. In this\narticle we present FLAS (Forecasted Load Auto-Scaling), an auto-scaler for\ndistributed services that combines the advantages of proactive and reactive\napproaches according to the situation to decide the optimal scaling actions in\nevery moment. The main novelties introduced by FLAS are (i) a predictive model\nof the high-level metrics trend which allows to anticipate changes in the\nrelevant SLA parameters (e.g. performance metrics such as response time or\nthroughput) and (ii) a reactive contingency system based on the estimation of\nhigh-level metrics from resource use metrics, reducing the necessary\ninstrumentation (less invasive) and allowing it to be adapted agnostically to\ndifferent applications. We provide a FLAS implementation for the use case of a\ncontent-based publish-subscribe middleware (E-SilboPS) that is the cornerstone\nof an event-driven architecture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst auto-scaling system for content-based publish-subscribe distributed\nsystems (although it is generic enough to fit any distributed service).

Second, 2-, 8-,\n16-, and 32-row activation-based TRNG designs outperform the state-of-theart\nDRAM-based TRNG in throughput by up to 1.15x, 1.99x, 1.82x, and 1.39x,\nrespectively.

Auto-scalers are the systems that enable this elasticity by acquiring\nand releasing resources on demand to ensure an agreed service level. In this\narticle we present FLAS (Forecasted Load Auto-Scaling), an auto-scaler for\ndistributed services that combines the advantages of proactive and reactive\napproaches according to the situation to decide the optimal scaling actions in\nevery moment. The main novelties introduced by FLAS are (i) a predictive model\nof the high-level metrics trend which allows to anticipate changes in the\nrelevant SLA parameters (e.g. performance metrics such as response time or\nthroughput) and (ii) a reactive contingency system based on the estimation of\nhigh-level metrics from resource use metrics, reducing the necessary\ninstrumentation (less invasive) and allowing it to be adapted agnostically to\ndifferent applications. We provide a FLAS implementation for the use case of a\ncontent-based publish-subscribe middleware (E-SilboPS) that is the cornerstone\nof an event-driven architecture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst auto-scaling system for content-based publish-subscribe distributed\nsystems (although it is generic enough to fit any distributed service). Through\nan evaluation based on several test cases recreating not only the expected\ncontexts of use, but also the worst possible scenarios (following the\nBoundary-Value Analysis or BVA test methodology), we have validated our\napproach and demonstrated the effectiveness of our solution by ensuring\ncompliance with performance requirements over 99% of the time."}

Specifically, AdaDoS models\nthe problem as a competitive game between an attacker, whose goal is to\nobstruct network traffic without being detected, and a detector, which aims to\nidentify malicious traffic. AdaDoS can solve this game by dynamically adjusting\nits attack strategy based on feedback from the SDN and the detector.\nAdditionally, recognising that attackers typically have less information than\ndefenders, AdaDoS formulates the DoS-like attack as a partially observed Markov\ndecision process (POMDP), with the attacker having access only to delay\ninformation between attacker and victim nodes. We address this challenge with a\nnovel reciprocal learning module, where the student agent, with limited\nobservations, enhances its performance by learning from the teacher agent, who\nhas full observational capabilities in the SDN environment. AdaDoS represents\nthe first application of RL to develop DoS-like attack sequences, capable of\nadaptively evading both machine learning-based and rule-based DoS-like attack\ndetectors."}

However, this design is susceptible to\npoisoning attacks, and previously proposed defenses can fail for CTI contexts\nas cyber threat information is often completely new for emerging attacks, and\nsophisticated threat actors can mimic legitimate formats, terminology, and\nstylistic conventions. To address this issue, we propose that the robustness of\nmodern RAG defenses can be accelerated by applying source credibility\nalgorithms on corpora, using PageRank as an example. In our experiments, we\ndemonstrate quantitatively that our algorithm applies a lower authority score\nto malicious documents while promoting trusted content, using the standardized\nMS MARCO dataset. We also demonstrate proof-of-concept performance of our\nalgorithm on CTI documents and feeds."}
