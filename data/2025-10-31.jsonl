Fast and\naccurate simulation approaches are critical to unlocking this potential, but\nexisting methods lack the required accuracy, speed, and flexibility. To address\nthis need, this work presents CHIPSIM, a comprehensive co-simulation framework\ndesigned for parallel DNN execution on chiplet-based systems. CHIPSIM\nconcurrently models computation and communication, accurately capturing network\ncontention and pipelining effects that conventional simulators overlook.\nFurthermore, it profiles the chiplet and NoI power consumptions at microsecond\ngranularity for precise transient thermal analysis. Extensive evaluations with\nhomogeneous/heterogeneous chiplets and different NoI architectures demonstrate\nthe framework's versatility, up to 340% accuracy improvement, and power/thermal\nanalysis capability."}

We introduce a\ntwo-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative\n(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must\nminimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the\nevolutionary \"why\" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.\nThe Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression\nmechanically selects for generative, causal models through\nexception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather\nthan a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:\nfrom survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,\nefficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality\nalignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or\nevolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically\nnecessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework\nyields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as\napproach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution\ngeneralization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from\ncorrelational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across\nabstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that\ntrack representational complexity.

However, despite a flurry of research since late\n2022, progress has been incremental, and the field lacks a cohesive\nunderstanding of the emerging architectural patterns, core challenges, and\nevaluation paradigms. To fill this gap, this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)\npaper provides the first comprehensive overview of this new domain. We survey\nand systematize three critical, intersecting research areas: first, we provide\na taxonomy of honeypot detection vectors, structuring the core problems that\nLLM-based realism must solve; second, we synthesize the emerging literature on\nLLM-honeypots, identifying a canonical architecture and key evaluation trends;\nand third, we chart the evolutionary path of honeypot log analysis, from simple\ndata reduction to automated intelligence generation. We synthesize these\nfindings into a forward-looking research roadmap, arguing that the true\npotential of this technology lies in creating autonomous, self-improving\ndeception systems to counter the emerging threat of intelligent, automated\nattackers."}

This will allow for the creation of practical tools --\nsuch as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target \"individual\" that can\nbe sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's\nconsciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles\nand discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining\nboth \"personhood as a problem\", where design choices can create \"dark patterns\"\nthat exploit human social heuristics, and \"personhood as a solution\", where\nconferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or\nprevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential\ndefinition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way\nto think about integrating AI agents into our society."}

If the\nagent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to\na corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a\ntwo-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies\nas a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an\nalignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value\nfunction, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits\nitself cannot harm the human's value.

We develop and evaluate a machine-learning-based workflow\nverification system that uses acoustic emissions generated by robotic\nmovements. The system can determine whether real-time behavior is consistent\nwith expected commands. The evaluation takes into account movement speed,\ndirection, and microphone distance. The results show that individual robot\nmovements can be validated with over 80% accuracy under baseline conditions\nusing four different classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Neural\nNetwork (DNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN). Additionally, workflows such as pick-and-place and packing could be\nidentified with similarly high confidence. Our findings demonstrate that\nacoustic signals can support real-time, low-cost, passive verification in\nsensitive robotic environments without requiring hardware modifications."}

We present SIRAJ: a generic\nred-teaming framework for arbitrary black-box LLM agents. We employ a dynamic\ntwo-step process that starts with an agent definition and generates diverse\nseed test cases that cover various risk outcomes, tool-use trajectories, and\nrisk sources. Then, it iteratively constructs and refines model-based\nadversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts. To\noptimize the red-teaming cost, we present a model distillation approach that\nleverages structured forms of a teacher model's reasoning to train smaller\nmodels that are equally effective. Across diverse evaluation agent settings,\nour seed test case generation approach yields 2 -- 2.5x boost to the coverage\nof risk outcomes and tool-calling trajectories. Our distilled 8B red-teamer\nmodel improves attack success rate by 100%, surpassing the 671B Deepseek-R1\nmodel. Our ablations and analyses validate the effectiveness of the iterative\nframework, structured reasoning, and the generalization of our red-teamer\nmodels."}

However, unauthorized commercial use of\nthese datasets severely violates the intellectual property rights of dataset\nowners. Existing backdoor-based dataset ownership verification methods suffer\nfrom inherent limitations: poison-label watermarks are easily detectable due to\nlabel inconsistencies, while clean-label watermarks face high technical\ncomplexity and failure on high-resolution images. Moreover, both approaches\nemploy static watermark patterns that are vulnerable to detection and removal.\nTo address these issues, this paper proposes a sample-specific clean-label\nbackdoor watermarking (i.e., SSCL-BW). By training a U-Net-based watermarked\nsample generator, this method generates unique watermarks for each sample,\nfundamentally overcoming the vulnerability of static watermark patterns. The\ncore innovation lies in designing a composite loss function with three\ncomponents: target sample loss ensures watermark effectiveness, non-target\nsample loss guarantees trigger reliability, and perceptual similarity loss\nmaintains visual imperceptibility. During ownership verification, black-box\ntesting is employed to check whether suspicious models exhibit predefined\nbackdoor behaviors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method and its robustness against potential\nwatermark removal attacks."}

To mitigate this,\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures activate only a small portion of\nparameters during inference, significantly lowering both memory demand and\ncomputational overhead. However, conventional MoE inference approaches, which\nselect active experts independently at each layer, often introduce considerable\nlatency because of frequent parameter transfers between host and GPU memory. In\naddition, current cross-layer prediction strategies, which are typically based\non fixed steps, lack adaptability across different hardware platforms and\nworkloads, thereby reducing their robustness and effectiveness.\n  To address these challenges, we present ExpertFlow, a runtime system for MoE\ninference that combines adaptive expert prefetching and cache-aware routing.\nExpertFlow continuously adjusts its prediction horizon for expert activation by\nleveraging runtime statistics such as transfer bandwidth, parameter\ndimensionality, and model feedback signals. Furthermore, it incorporates a\nhybrid cross-layer prediction scheme that fuses pregating information with\nintermediate computational states to anticipate future expert needs. By\nadaptively refining prefetching decisions and aligning them with actual usage\nbehavior, ExpertFlow effectively decreases cache misses and removes latency\ncaused by expert swap-ins. Our evaluation demonstrates that ExpertFlow reduces\nmodel stall time to less than 0.1% of the baseline, highlighting its capability\nto optimize MoE inference under stringent memory constraints."}
