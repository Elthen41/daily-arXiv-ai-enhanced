This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and\ndynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data\nscheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.\nHowever, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based\nmetrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these\nqueries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score\n(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the\nstructure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning\nTree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a\ncurriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low\nr-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that\nRe-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to\n3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a\nstructural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and\nprincipled foundation for RLVR data scheduling."}

While\nprior research has focused on protecting privacy in a single data release, many\nreal-world systems operate under sequential or continuous data publishing,\nwhere the same or related data are released over time. Such sequential\ndisclosures introduce new vulnerabilities, as temporal correlations across\nreleases may enable adversaries to infer sensitive information that remains\nhidden in any individual release. In this paper, we investigate whether an\nattacker can compromise privacy in sequential data releases by exploiting\ndependencies between consecutive publications, even when each individual\nrelease satisfies standard privacy guarantees. To this end, we propose a novel\nattack model that captures these sequential dependencies by integrating a\nHidden Markov Model with a reinforcement learning-based bi-directional\ninference mechanism. This enables the attacker to leverage both earlier and\nlater observations in the sequence to infer private information. We instantiate\nour framework in the context of trajectory data, demonstrating how an adversary\ncan recover sensitive locations from sequential mobility datasets. Extensive\nexperiments on Geolife, Porto Taxi, and SynMob datasets show that our model\nconsistently outperforms baseline approaches that treat each release\nindependently.

Perception computing\nis typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale\ndeep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous\nstudies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,\nquantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,\nthese methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant\ndrop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address\nthese challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,\ncalled EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization\nstrategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.\nFirstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational\nconsumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically.

Agents execute the same\nalgorithm, which they start when activated by an adversary or by an agent\nentering their initial node. When activated, agents traverse edges of the\nnetwork in synchronous rounds. Their perception and communication are strictly\nlocal. This task, known as gathering, is a central problem in distributed\nmobile systems. Most prior work focuses on minimizing its time complexity,\ni.e., the worst-case number of rounds between the start of the earliest agent\nand the task completion. To break possible symmetries, deterministic solutions\ntypically assume that agents have pairwise distinct IDs, called labels, known\nonly to themselves.

Our contribution is threefold. (1) We give\na full characterization of the gatherable teams.

These goals, which include tendencies such\nas power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict\nwith human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as\nsources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward\nhacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of\ninstrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This\narticle proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be\nconstructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features\nto be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on\nAristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,\ngoal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as\nartifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct\nfrom their designers' intentions.
