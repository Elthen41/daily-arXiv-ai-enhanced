Advancements in deep learning and specialized hardware have driven the rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems. However, traditional GPU-centric architectures face scalability challenges for inference workloads due to limitations in memory capacity, bandwidth, and interconnect scaling. To address these issues, the FengHuang Platform, a disaggregated AI infrastructure platform, is proposed to overcome memory and communication scaling limits for AI inference. FengHuang features a multi-tier shared-memory architecture combining high-speed local memory with centralized disaggregated remote memory, enhanced by active tensor paging and near-memory compute for tensor operations. Simulations demonstrate that FengHuang achieves up to 93% local memory capacity reduction, 50% GPU compute savings, and 16x to 70x faster inter-GPU communication compared to conventional GPU scaling. Across workloads such as GPT-3, Grok-1, and QWEN3-235B, FengHuang enables up to 50% GPU reductions while maintaining end-user performance, offering a scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solution for AI inference infrastructure. FengHuang provides an optimal balance as a rack-level AI infrastructure scale-up solution. Its open, heterogeneous design eliminates vendor lock-in and enhances supply chain flexibility, enabling significant infrastructure and power cost reductions.", "AI": {"tldr": "FengHuang\u5e73\u53f0\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u8026\u7684AI\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u7ea7\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u901f\u672c\u5730\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u9875\u548c\u8fd1\u5185\u5b58\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u89e3\u51b3AI\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6269\u5c55\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfGPU\u4e2d\u5fc3\u67b6\u6784\u5728AI\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u4e92\u8fde\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFengHuang\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u7ea7\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u901f\u672c\u5730\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u89e3\u8026\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u9875\u548c\u8fd1\u5185\u5b58\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u5f20\u91cf\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793aFengHuang\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe93%\u7684\u672c\u5730\u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u300150%\u7684GPU\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfGPU\u6269\u5c55\u5feb16\u500d\u523070\u500d\u7684GPU\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u5728GPT-3\u3001Grok-1\u548cQWEN3-235B\u7b49\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe50%\u7684GPU\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FengHuang\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684AI\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u673a\u67b6\u7ea7AI\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5176\u5f00\u653e\u5f02\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u9501\u5b9a\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

While effective GUI agents synergistically integrate planning and grounding capabilities, current methodologies exhibit two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies, and (2) over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Co-EPG, a self-iterative training framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding. Co-EPG establishes an iterative positive feedback loop: through this loop, the planning model explores superior strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model. Concurrently, the optimized Grounding model provides more effective rewards for subsequent GRPO training of the planning model, fostering continuous improvement. Co-EPG thus enables iterative enhancement of agent capabilities through self-play optimization and training data distillation. On the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data. The agent consistently improves with each iteration, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities.

However, conventional I/O circuitry, including electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection and signaling, introduces significant area overhead. Prior studies have identified this overhead as a major constraint in reducing chiplet size below 100 mm2. In this study, we revisit reliability requirements from the perspective of chiplet interface design. Through parasitic extraction and SPICE simulations, we demonstrate that ESD protection and inter-chiplet signaling can be substantially simplified in future 2.5D/3D packaging technologies. Such simplification, in turn, paves the road for further chiplet miniaturization and improves the composability and reusability of tiny chiplets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86\u82af\u7247\u63a5\u53e3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u672a\u67652.5D/3D\u5c01\u88c5\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\uff0cESD\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u82af\u7247\u95f4\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u8f93\u53ef\u4ee5\u5927\u5e45\u7b80\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u82af\u7247\u5c0f\u578b\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfI/O\u7535\u8def\uff08\u5305\u62ecESD\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u8f93\uff09\u57282.5D/3D\u5f02\u6784\u96c6\u6210\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u8457\u9762\u79ef\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u5236\u7ea6\u82af\u7247\u5c3a\u5bf8\u51cf\u5c0f\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc4\u751f\u53c2\u6570\u63d0\u53d6\u548cSPICE\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u4ece\u82af\u7247\u63a5\u53e3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5728\u672a\u67652.5D/3D\u5c01\u88c5\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\uff0cESD\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u82af\u7247\u95f4\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u8f93\u53ef\u4ee5\u5927\u5e45\u7b80\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u82af\u7247\u5c0f\u578b\u5316\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5fae\u578b\u82af\u7247\u7684\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose BadThink, the first backdoor attack designed to deliberately induce \"overthinking\" behavior in CoT-enabled LLMs while ensuring stealth. When activated by carefully crafted trigger prompts, BadThink manipulates the model to generate inflated reasoning traces - producing unnecessarily redundant thought processes while preserving the consistency of final outputs. This subtle attack vector creates a covert form of performance degradation that significantly increases computational costs and inference time while remaining difficult to detect through conventional output evaluation methods. We implement this attack through a sophisticated poisoning-based fine-tuning strategy, employing a novel LLM-based iterative optimization process to embed the behavior by generating highly naturalistic poisoned data. Our experiments on multiple state-of-the-art models and reasoning tasks show that BadThink consistently increases reasoning trace lengths - achieving an over 17x increase on the MATH-500 dataset - while remaining stealthy and robust.

Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives.

Existing prompt injection defenses are designed for short contexts. When extended to long-context scenarios, they have limited effectiveness. The reason is that an injected instruction constitutes only a very small portion of a long context, making the defense very challenging. In this work, we propose PISanitizer, which first pinpoints and sanitizes potential injected tokens (if any) in a context before letting a backend LLM generate a response, thereby eliminating the influence of the injected instruction. To sanitize injected tokens, PISanitizer builds on two observations: (1) prompt injection attacks essentially craft an instruction that compels an LLM to follow it, and (2) LLMs intrinsically leverage the attention mechanism to focus on crucial input tokens for output generation. Guided by these two observations, we first intentionally let an LLM follow arbitrary instructions in a context and then sanitize tokens receiving high attention that drive the instruction-following behavior of the LLM. By design, PISanitizer presents a dilemma for an attacker: the more effectively an injected instruction compels an LLM to follow it, the more likely it is to be sanitized by PISanitizer. Our extensive evaluation shows that PISanitizer can successfully prevent prompt injection, maintain utility, outperform existing defenses, is efficient, and is robust to optimization-based and strong adaptive attacks.

It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties.

To support them, current devices are adopting SoCs (System on Chip) with NPUs (Neural Processing Unit) installed. Although high performance is expected, LLM inference on NPUs is slower than its CPU counterpart. The reason is that NPUs have poor performance on computations other than GEMM, like dequantization. Current works either disaggregate prefill on the NPUs and decoding on the CPUs, or put both on the NPUs but with an accuracy loss. To solve this issue, based on the insight that low-bit can enable target computation encoded within an acceptably sized table, we propose table lookup to subsume hardware operations otherwise unsupported. To realize this, we overcome the conflicting hardware behavior of prefill and decoding to design a unified table layout and tiling through (1) fused two-level table-based dequantization and (2) concurrency-hierarchy-guided tiling. Based on that, we implement the prefill phase by three-stage pipeline and map the table-lookup-based decoding to NPU's vector units. Results show 1.4x and 3.1x speedup for prefill and decoding respectively, and 84% energy savings compared to the baseline NPU methods.

The core of directed fuzzing is the guiding mechanism that directs the fuzzing to the specified target. A general guiding mechanism adopted in existing directed fuzzers is to calculate the control-flow distance between the current progress and the target, and use that as feedback to guide the directed fuzzing. A fundamental problem with the existing guiding mechanism is that the distance calculation is \\emph{feasibility-unaware}.\n  In this work, we propose feasibility-aware directed fuzzing named AFLGopher. Our new feasibility-aware distance calculation provides pragmatic feedback to guide directed fuzzing to reach targets efficiently. We propose new techniques to address the challenges of feasibility prediction. Our new classification method allows us to predict the feasibility of all branches based on limited traces, and our runtime feasibility-updating mechanism gradually and efficiently improves the prediction precision.

Armadillo is designed for federated learning setting, where a single powerful server interacts with many weak clients iteratively to train models on client's private data. While a few prior works consider disruption resistance under such setting, they either incur high per-client cost (Chowdhury et al. CCS '22) or require many rounds (Bell et al. USENIX Security '23). Although disruption resistance can be achieved generically with zero-knowledge proof techniques (which we also use in this paper), we realize an efficient system with two new designs: 1) a simple two-layer secure aggregation protocol that requires only simple arithmetic computation; 2) an agreement protocol that removes the effect of malicious clients from the aggregation with low round complexity. With these techniques, Armadillo completes each secure aggregation in 3 rounds while keeping the server and clients computationally lightweight.", "AI": {"tldr": "Armadillo\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6297\u7834\u574f\u6027\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u62b5\u5fa1\u6076\u610f\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u805a\u5408\u7ed3\u679c\u53ea\u53d7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5728\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u5408\u6cd5\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8bef\u62a5\u79c1\u6709\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6297\u7834\u574f\u6027\u65b9\u6848\u8981\u4e48\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u591a\u8f6e\u901a\u4fe1\u3002Armadillo\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6297\u7834\u574f\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u8f6e\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u79fb\u9664\u6076\u610f\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u96f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc1\u660e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u7b80\u5355\u7b97\u672f\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "Armadillo\u57283\u8f6e\u901a\u4fe1\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8f7b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Armadillo\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6297\u7834\u574f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies.

However, the emergence of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we investigate the intersection of diffusion-based image editing and robust image watermarking. We analyze how diffusion-driven image edits can significantly degrade or even fully remove embedded watermarks from state-of-the-art robust watermarking systems. Both theoretical formulations and empirical experiments are provided. We prove that as a image undergoes iterative diffusion transformations, the mutual information between the watermarked image and the embedded payload approaches zero, causing watermark decoding to fail. We further propose a guided diffusion attack algorithm that explicitly targets and erases watermark signals during generation. We evaluate our approach on recent deep learning-based watermarking schemes and demonstrate near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual fidelity of the regenerated images.

Competitive genres-such as Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA), First Person Shooter (FPS), Real Time Strategy (RTS), and Action games-remain underexplored due to the difficulty of detecting cheating users and the demand for complex data and techniques. To address this gap, many game companies rely on kernel-level anti-cheat solutions, which, while effective, raise serious concerns regarding user privacy and system security. In this paper, we propose GYNOPTICON, a novel cheating detection framework that leverages user consensus to identify abnormal behavior. GYNOPTICON integrates a lightweight client-side detection mechanism with a server-side voting system: when suspicious activity is identified, clients cast votes to the server, which aggregates them to establish consensus and distinguish cheaters from legitimate players. This architecture enables transparency, reduces reliance on intrusive monitoring, and mitigates privacy risks. We evaluate GYNOPTICON in both a controlled simulation and a real-world FPS environment. Simulation results verify its feasibility and requirements, while real-world experiments confirm its effectiveness in reliably detecting cheating users. Furthermore, we demonstrate the system's applicability and sustainability for long-term game management using public datasets.

However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation.

The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset.

We analyzed eight attack scenarios in four categories: architectural attacks on convolutional neural networks, large language models, and reinforcement learning agents; infrastructure attacks exploiting federated learning and medical documentation systems; critical resource allocation attacks affecting organ transplantation and crisis triage; and supply chain attacks targeting commercial foundation models. Our findings indicate that attackers with access to only 100-500 samples can compromise healthcare AI regardless of dataset size, often achieving over 60 percent success, with detection taking an estimated 6 to 12 months or sometimes not occurring at all. The distributed nature of healthcare infrastructure creates many entry points where insiders with routine access can launch attacks with limited technical skill. Privacy laws such as HIPAA and GDPR can unintentionally shield attackers by restricting the analyses needed for detection. Supply chain weaknesses allow a single compromised vendor to poison models across 50 to 200 institutions. The Medical Scribe Sybil scenario shows how coordinated fake patient visits can poison data through legitimate clinical workflows without requiring a system breach.

Neither meets 5G New Radio (NR)-V2X's stringent requirements for both immediate authentication and computational efficiency. This paper presents SALT-V, a novel hybrid authentication framework that reconciles this fundamental trade-off through intelligent protocol stratification. SALT-V employs ECDSA signatures for 10% of traffic (BOOT frames) to establish sender trust, then leverages this trust anchor to authenticate 90% of messages (DATA frames) using lightweight GMAC operations. The core innovation - an Ephemeral Session Tag (EST) whitelist mechanism - enables 95% of messages to achieve immediate verification without waiting for key disclosure, while Bloom filter integration provides O(1) revocation checking in 1 us. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SALT-V achieves 0.035 ms average computation time (57x faster than pure ECDSA), 1 ms end-to-end latency, 41-byte overhead, and linear scalability to 2000 vehicles, making it the first practical solution to satisfy all safety-critical requirements for real-time V2X deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "SALT-V\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8bae\u5206\u5c42\u89e3\u51b3V2X\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ECDSA\u548cGMAC\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5373\u65f6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u516c\u94a5\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u5982ECDSA\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\uff082ms\uff09\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\uff1b\u5bf9\u79f0\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u5982TESLA\uff09\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4f46\u5bc6\u94a5\u62ab\u9732\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5927\uff0820-100ms\uff09\uff0c\u90fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db35G NR-V2X\u5bf9\u5373\u65f6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a10%\u6d41\u91cf\uff08BOOT\u5e27\uff09\u4f7f\u7528ECDSA\u7b7e\u540d\u5efa\u7acb\u53d1\u9001\u8005\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c90%\u6d88\u606f\uff08DATA\u5e27\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7GMAC\u64cd\u4f5c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u662f\u4e34\u65f6\u4f1a\u8bdd\u6807\u7b7e\uff08EST\uff09\u767d\u540d\u5355\u673a\u5236\u548cBloom\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "SALT-V\u5b9e\u73b00.035ms\u5e73\u5747\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u6bd4\u7eafECDSA\u5feb57\u500d\uff09\uff0c1ms\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c41\u5b57\u8282\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u53ef\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u52302000\u8f86\u8f66\uff0c95%\u6d88\u606f\u65e0\u9700\u7b49\u5f85\u5bc6\u94a5\u62ab\u9732\u5373\u53ef\u5373\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "SALT-V\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6V2X\u90e8\u7f72\u6240\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8c03\u548c\u4e86\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u65f6\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u75be\u75c5\u4f20\u64ad\u57fa\u8d28\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u75c5\u7406\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5f53\u7ea6\u675f\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u75be\u75c5\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4ece\u4e2a\u4f53\u89c2\u5bdf\u6784\u5efa\u957f\u671f\u75be\u75c5\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u7684\u751f\u7269\u7ea6\u675f\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u961f\u5217\u7684tau-PET\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u8fde\u63a5\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u989d\u5916\u75be\u75c5\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408LLMs\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u75be\u75c5\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In federated learning (FL), where data remains distributed across multiple parties during collaborative model training, normalization presents unique challenges due to the decentralized and often heterogeneous nature of the data. Traditional methods rely on either independent client-side processing, i.e., local normalization, or normalizing the entire dataset before distributing it to parties, i.e., pooled normalization. Local normalization can be problematic when data distributions across parties are non-IID, while the pooled normalization approach conflicts with the decentralized nature of FL. In this paper, we explore the adaptation of widely used normalization techniques to FL and define the term federated normalization. Federated normalization simulates pooled normalization by enabling the collaborative exchange of normalization parameters among parties. Thus, it achieves performance on par with pooled normalization without compromising data locality. However, sharing normalization parameters such as the mean introduces potential privacy risks, which we further mitigate through a robust privacy-preserving solution. Our contributions include: (i) We systematically evaluate the impact of various federated and local normalization techniques in heterogeneous FL scenarios, (ii) We propose a novel homomorphically encrypted $k$-th ranked element (and median) calculation tailored for the federated setting, enabling secure and efficient federated normalization, (iii) We propose privacy-preserving implementations of widely used normalization techniques for FL, leveraging multiparty fully homomorphic encryption (MHE).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u4ea4\u6362\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u53c2\u4e0e\u65b9\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u672c\u5730\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5728\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u8fdd\u80cc\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u672c\u5730\u5316\u53c8\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6548\u679c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u90a6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u4ea4\u6362\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u7684k\u9636\u5143\u7d20\uff08\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u591a\u65b9\u5168\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u8054\u90a6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u7834\u574f\u6570\u636e\u672c\u5730\u5316\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u90a6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u662f\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual \"knowledge\" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9047\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u672a\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bc1\u660e\u5019\u9009\u884c\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4eba\u7c7b\u671f\u671b\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5fc5\u7136\u4f1a\u9047\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u672a\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u884c\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u671f\u671b\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u6240\u9700\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u505a\u51fa\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u5bf9\u9f50\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6240\u9700\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6267\u884c\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u671f\u671b\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While these innovations offer significant advantages, they also present potential drawbacks if the smart contract code is not carefully designed and implemented. This paper investigates the capability of large language models (LLMs) to detect OWASP-inspired vulnerabilities in smart contracts beyond the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem, focusing specifically on Solana and Algorand. Given the lack of labeled datasets for non-EVM platforms, we design a synthetic dataset of annotated smart contract snippets in Rust (for Solana) and PyTeal (for Algorand), structured around a vulnerability taxonomy derived from OWASP. We evaluate LLMs under three configurations: prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and a hybrid of both, comparing their performance on different vulnerability categories. Experimental results show that prompt engineering achieves general robustness, while fine-tuning improves precision and recall on less semantically rich languages such as TEAL. Additionally, we analyze how the architectural differences of Solana and Algorand influence the manifestation and detectability of vulnerabilities, offering platform-specific mappings that highlight limitations in existing security tooling.

Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to \"break\" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akg\u00fcn et al. 2025).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6253\u7834\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u5176\u8868\u793a\u6765\u5904\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u5d4c\u5957\u96c6\u5408\uff09\u9700\u8981\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u652f\u6301\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6765\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08Akg\u00fcn et al. 2025\uff09\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, training such models requires substantial computational resources, large curated datasets, and sophisticated alignment procedures. As a result, they constitute highly valuable intellectual property (IP) assets that warrant robust protection mechanisms. Existing IP protection approaches suffer from critical limitations. Model fingerprinting techniques can identify model architectures but fail to establish ownership of specific model instances. In contrast, traditional backdoor-based watermarking methods embed behavioral anomalies that can be easily removed through common post-processing operations such as fine-tuning or knowledge distillation.\n  We propose SEAL, a subspace-anchored watermarking framework that embeds multi-bit signatures directly into the model's latent representational space, supporting both white-box and black-box verification scenarios. Our approach leverages model editing techniques to align the hidden representations of selected anchor samples with predefined orthogonal bit vectors. This alignment embeds the watermark while preserving the model's original factual predictions, rendering the watermark functionally harmless and stealthy. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and six prominent LLMs, comparing SEAL with 11 existing fingerprinting and watermarking methods to demonstrate its superior effectiveness, fidelity, efficiency, and robustness. Furthermore, we evaluate SEAL under potential knowledgeable attacks and show that it maintains strong verification performance even when adversaries possess knowledge of the watermarking mechanism and the embedded signatures.", "AI": {"tldr": "SEAL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u951a\u5b9a\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u7b7e\u540d\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u767d\u76d2\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5b9d\u8d35\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709IP\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u7eb9\u6280\u672f\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u5177\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u540e\u95e8\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7b49\u540e\u5904\u7406\u64cd\u4f5c\u79fb\u9664\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u9009\u5b9a\u951a\u70b9\u6837\u672c\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6b63\u4ea4\u6bd4\u7279\u5411\u91cf\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u539f\u59cb\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5d4c\u5165\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u4f7f\u6c34\u5370\u529f\u80fd\u65e0\u5bb3\u4e14\u9690\u853d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u516d\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSEAL\u76f8\u6bd411\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5bf9\u624b\u4e86\u89e3\u6c34\u5370\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u7b7e\u540d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SEAL\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684IP\u4fdd\u62a4\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u951a\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e2\u6709\u6548\u53c8\u9690\u853d\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u5d4c\u5165\u3002"}}

Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, \"Truth Last\", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth.

This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) examines CSI-based biometric authentication through a security perspective, analyzing how existing work differs across sensing infrastructure, signal representations, feature pipelines, learning models, and evaluation methodologies. Our synthesis reveals systemic inconsistencies: reliance on aggregate accuracy metrics, limited reporting of FAR/FRR/EER, absence of per-user risk analysis, and scarce consideration of threat models or adversarial feasibility. We construct a unified evaluation framework to empirically expose these issues and demonstrate how security-relevant metrics, such as per-class EER, FCS, and the Gini Coefficient, uncover risk concentration that remains hidden under traditional reporting practices. Our analysis highlights concrete attack surfaces and shows how methodological choices materially influence vulnerability profiles, which include replay, geometric mimicry, and environmental perturbation. Based on these findings, we articulate the security boundaries of current CSI biometrics and provide guidelines for rigorous evaluation, reproducible experimentation, and future research directions. This SoK offers the security community a structured, evidence-driven reassessment of Wi-Fi CSI biometrics and their suitability as an authentication primitive.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u4e86Wi-Fi CSI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "Wi-Fi CSI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u6280\u672f\u867d\u7136\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u5b89\u5168\u89d2\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3001\u4fe1\u53f7\u8868\u793a\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u7ba1\u9053\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5b9e\u8bc1\u63ed\u793a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1a\u4f9d\u8d56\u805a\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u3001\u6709\u9650\u7684FAR/FRR/EER\u62a5\u544a\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6bcf\u7528\u6237\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5f88\u5c11\u8003\u8651\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u5bf9\u6297\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6807\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u62a5\u544a\u65b9\u6cd5\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u96c6\u4e2d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u5f53\u524dCSI\u751f\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u793e\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9Wi-Fi CSI\u751f\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u6280\u672f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u8bc1\u539f\u8bed\u9002\u7528\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

We further introduce a methodology to analyze cryptographic protocol implementations for their resilience to side-channel attacks. This is achieved by extending the CryptoBap framework to integrate hardware leakage contracts into the protocol model, which we then pass to the state-of-the-art protocol prover, DeepSec. This enables a detailed security analysis against both functional bugs and microarchitectural side-channel attacks. Using this methodology, we identify a privacy attack in WhatsApp that allows a side-channel attacker to learn the victim's contacts and confirm a known unlinkability attack on the BAC protocol used in electronic passports.\n  Key contributions include (1) the first formal model of WhatsApp, extracted from its binary, (2) a framework to integrate side-channel leakage contracts into protocol models for the first time, and (3) revealing critical vulnerabilities invisible to specification-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4eceWhatsApp\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u9996\u4e2a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4fa7\u4fe1\u9053\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5408\u7ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u5df2\u77e5\u6f0f\u6d1e", "motivation": "\u5206\u6790\u5927\u578b\u95ed\u6e90\u5e94\u7528WhatsApp\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4fa7\u4fe1\u9053\u653b\u51fb\u62b5\u6297\u529b\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u89c4\u8303\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5206\u6790(CryptoBap)\u548c\u9006\u5411\u5de5\u7a0b(Ghidra)\u63d0\u53d6\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6269\u5c55CryptoBap\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u786c\u4ef6\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5408\u7ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DeepSec\u534f\u8bae\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u524d\u5411\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u514b\u9686\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0WhatsApp\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u89c4\u8303\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u6cc4\u9732\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u8054\u7cfb\u4eba\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u7535\u5b50\u62a4\u7167BAC\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u975e\u94fe\u63a5\u6027\u653b\u51fb", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2aWhatsApp\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u96c6\u6210\u4fa7\u4fe1\u9053\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u89c4\u8303\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6f0f\u6d1e"}}

Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like \"Who is Undercover?\". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting \"undercover\" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions. Collectively, these innovations offer a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5367\u5e95\u6e38\u620f\uff08MUG\uff09\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e7b\u89c9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\uff08MAD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u8fa9\u8bba\u8005\u90fd\u662f\u7406\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MUG\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u4ea4\u63a8\u7406\u6e38\u620f\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e7b\u89c9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u8bc1\u636e\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "MUG\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86MAD\uff1a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u6539\u8bc1\u636e\u6e90\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u8bc1\u636e\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u800c\u975e\u88ab\u52a8\u56de\u7b54\u3002", "conclusion": "MUG\u4e3aLLMs\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u5728GitHub\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability.

We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4ABox\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u56de\u7b54\"\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48a\u662fC\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u800cb\u4e0d\u662f\"\u8fd9\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e0e\u5355\u72ec\u89e3\u91ca\u6b63\u5411\u8574\u542b\u6216\u7f3a\u5931\u8574\u542b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u91ca\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u4e24\u8005\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4e8ea\u548cb\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u5171\u6027\u548c\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u5355\u72ec\u89e3\u91ca\u6b63\u5411\u8574\u542b\uff08\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48C(a)\u88ab\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u8574\u542b\uff09\u6216\u7f3a\u5931\u8574\u542b\uff08\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48C(b)\u4e0d\u88ab\u8574\u542b\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u56de\u7b54\"\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48a\u662fC\u800cb\u4e0d\u662f\"\u8fd9\u7c7b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684ABox\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u548c\u66f4\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u91ca\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4ABox\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6bd4ABox\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u56de\u7b54\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u6b63\u5411\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u8574\u542b\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle. Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show that EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost, thereby offering a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "EcoAlign\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u7406\u6027\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7528\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7528\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76f2\u76ee\u6027\u4f1a\u6d6a\u8d39\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5728\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\uff0c\u6709\u5bb3\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u826f\u6027\u7406\u7531\u4f2a\u88c5\u800c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u5c06LVLM\u89c6\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u7406\u6027\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u589e\u91cf\u6269\u5c55\u601d\u7ef4\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u7c7b\u4f3c\u51c0\u73b0\u503c\uff09\u5bf9\u884c\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u8861\u9884\u671f\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7528\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u5269\u4f59\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5f31\u73af\u8282\u539f\u5219\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57283\u4e2a\u95ed\u6e90\u548c2\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u76846\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEcoAlign\u4ee5\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "EcoAlign\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065\u7684LVLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u539f\u5219\u6027\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods.

However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8c03\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u9762\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u901a\u4fe1\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u6d88\u606f\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u4f20\u8f93\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6709\u9650\u5e26\u5bbd\uff09\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fSLAM\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MARL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u901a\u4fe1\u662f\u77ac\u65f6\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u5e26\u5bbd\u65e0\u9650\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5f88\u5c11\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u67e5\u548c\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5728\u6d88\u606f\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u4f20\u8f93\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6709\u9650\u5e26\u5bbd\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684MARL\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4e09\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9eMARL\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u5e26\u5bbd\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u9690\u79c1\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5f25\u5408\u7406\u8bbaMARL\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework.

While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.", "AI": {"tldr": "EGuR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542bLLM\u8c03\u7528\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u3001\u91c7\u6837\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7d2f\u79ef\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u65e0\u6cd5\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u80fd\u4fee\u6539\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u79bb\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u4e14\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u65e0\u6cd5\u6539\u53d8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u6240\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5143\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1aGuide\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u7b56\u7565\uff0cConsolidator\u6574\u5408\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u6539\u8fdb\u672a\u6765\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cEGuR\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe14%\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe111\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u7ecf\u9a8c\u79ef\u7d2f\u6027\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "EGuR\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, it also introduces a new threat: model merging stealing, where free-riders exploit models through unauthorized model merging. Unfortunately, existing defense mechanisms fail to provide effective protection. Specifically, we identify three critical protection properties that existing methods fail to simultaneously satisfy: (1) proactively preventing unauthorized merging; (2) ensuring compatibility with general open-source settings; (3) achieving high security with negligible performance loss. To address the above issues, we propose MergeBarrier, a plug-and-play defense that proactively prevents unauthorized merging.
