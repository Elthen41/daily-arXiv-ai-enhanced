This study compared image generation in human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and using an image generation AI model (two prompting conditions with varying human input: high for Human Inspired, low for Self Guided). Human raters (N=255) and GPT4o evaluated the creativity of the resulting images. We found a clear creativity gradient, with Visual Artists being the most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired generative AI, and finally Self Guided generative AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists. Notably, human and AI raters also showed vastly different creativity judgment patterns. These results suggest that, in contrast to language centered tasks, GenAI models may face unique challenges in visual domains, where creativity depends on perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity, distinctly human capacities that may not be readily transferable from language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance. This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item. When empirically estimated values for these statistics fall outside the expected range for an item, the item is more likely to be problematic. Across nine widely used benchmarks, our method guides expert review to identify problematic questions with up to 84\\% precision.

This phenomenon results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradients, significantly hindering algorithm convergence and performance improvement. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism. We first theoretically elucidate how the temporal quasi-steady nature of traffic states and the physical proximity of actions lead to the failure of traditional reward signals. Building on this analysis, the HDR framework innovatively integrates two complementary components: (1) a Temporal Difference Reward (TRD) based on a global potential function, which utilizes the evolutionary trend of potential energy to ensure optimal policy invariance and consistency with long-term objectives; and (2) an Action Gradient Reward (ARG), which directly measures the marginal utility of actions to provide a local guidance signal with a high SNR. Furthermore, we formulate the cooperative driving problem as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG) with a time-varying agent set and provide a complete instantiation scheme for HDR within this framework. Extensive experiments conducted using both online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) algorithms demonstrate that the HDR mechanism significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability. The results confirm that HDR guides agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies that effectively balance traffic efficiency and safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u5dee\u5206\u5956\u52b1(HDR)\u673a\u5236\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u8f66\u8f86\u534f\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5dee\u5f02\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5dee\u5206\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u68af\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u8f66\u8f86\u534f\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5b58\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u5dee\u5f02\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u5dee\u5206\u5956\u52b1(HDR)\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5dee\u5206\u5956\u52b1(TRD)\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fb9\u9645\u6548\u7528\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u68af\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1(ARG)\u3002\u5c06\u534f\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u53d8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u96c6\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212(MCTS)\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(QMIX\u3001MAPPO\u3001MADDPG)\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHDR\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HDR\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u591f\u5f15\u5bfc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4ea4\u901a\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

This behavior significantly increases security risks, also due to the fact that traditional password strength evaluation methods are often inadequate. In this discussion paper, we present SODA ADVANCE, a data reconstruction tool also designed to enhance evaluation processes related to the password strength. In particular, SODA ADVANCE integrates a specialized module aimed at evaluating password strength by leveraging publicly available data from multiple sources, including social media platforms.

Massive-scale AI models, which mimic the human brain's functionality, typically feature millions and even billions of parameters through data-intensive matrix multiplication tasks. While conventional Von-Neumann architectures struggle with the memory wall and the end of Moore's Law, these AI applications are migrating rapidly towards the edge, such as in robotics and unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance, thereby adding more constraints to the hardware budget of AI architectures at the edge. Although in-memory computing has been proposed as a promising solution for the memory wall, both analog and digital in-memory computing architectures suffer from substantial degradation of the proposed benefits due to various design limitations. We propose a new digital in-memory stochastic computing architecture, DISCA, utilizing a compressed version of the quasi-stochastic Bent-Pyramid data format. DISCA inherits the same computational simplicity of analog computing, while preserving the same scalability, productivity, and reliability of digital systems. Post-layout modeling results of DISCA show an energy efficiency of 3.59 TOPS/W per bit at 500 MHz using a commercial 180nm CMOS technology.

These attacks may pose significant privacy risks to individuals whose sensitive data were used for training, which motivates the use of defenses such as differential privacy, often at the cost of high accuracy losses. MIAs exploit the differences in the behavior of a model when making predictions on samples it has seen during training (members) versus those it has not seen (non-members). Several studies have pointed out that model overfitting is the major factor contributing to these differences in behavior and, consequently, to the success of MIAs. However, the literature also shows that even non-overfitted ML models can leak information about a small subset of their training data. In this paper, we investigate the root causes of membership inference vulnerabilities beyond traditional overfitting concerns and suggest targeted defenses. We empirically analyze the characteristics of the training data samples vulnerable to MIAs in models that are not overfitted (and hence able to generalize).

However, this formulation fails to explain its practical behavior: the prior offers limited guidance, while reconstruction is largely driven by the measurement-consistency term, leading to an inference process that is effectively decoupled from the diffusion dynamics. To clarify this structure, we reinterpret the role of diffusion in inverse problem solving as an initialization stage within an expectation--maximization (EM)--style framework, where the diffusion stage and the data-driven refinement are fully decoupled. We introduce \\textbf{DAPS++}, which allows the likelihood term to guide inference more directly while maintaining numerical stability and providing insight into why unified diffusion trajectories remain effective in practice. By requiring fewer function evaluations (NFEs) and measurement-optimization steps, \\textbf{DAPS++} achieves high computational efficiency and robust reconstruction performance across diverse image restoration tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDAPS++\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u9636\u6bb5\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7ec6\u5316\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u5148\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9879\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u8026\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6f84\u6e05\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u671f\u671b\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff08EM\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDAPS++\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f3c\u7136\u9879\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u5730\u6307\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "DAPS++\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u9636\u6bb5\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7ec6\u5316\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u8026\uff0cDAPS++\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In most of these approaches, hardware extensions such as Intel SGX, TDX, AMD SEV, etc., are leveraged to provide encryption and integrity protection on process or VM level. Although all of these approaches increase the trust in the application at runtime, an often overlooked aspect is the integrity and confidentiality protection at build time, which is equally important as maliciously injected code during compilation can compromise the entire application and system.In this paper, we present Tical, a practical framework for trusted compilation that provides integrity protection and confidentiality in build pipelines from source code to the final executable. Our approach harnesses TEEs as runtime protection but enriches TEEs with file system shielding and an immutable audit log with version history to provide accountability. This way, we can ensure that the compiler chain can only access trusted files and intermediate output, such as object files produced by trusted processes. Our evaluation using micro- and macro-benchmarks shows that Tical can protect the confidentiality and integrity of whole CI/CD pipelines with an acceptable performance overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "Tical\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u7f16\u8bd1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e2d\u4ece\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6587\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u673a\u5bc6\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u786c\u4ef6\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u4f46\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u673a\u5bc6\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u540c\u6837\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6076\u610f\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u53ef\u80fd\u5371\u53ca\u6574\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528TEEs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c4f\u853d\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d8\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65e5\u5fd7\u589e\u5f3aTEEs\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u94fe\u53ea\u80fd\u8bbf\u95ee\u53d7\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u548c\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aTical\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5f00\u9500\u4fdd\u62a4\u6574\u4e2aCI/CD\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u7684\u673a\u5bc6\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Tical\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

Preprint on cryptographic evidence and compliance for regulated AI workflows", "summary": "This paper introduces constant-size cryptographic evidence structures, a general abstraction for representing verifiable audit evidence for AI workflows in regulated environments. Each evidence item is a fixed-size tuple of cryptographic fields, designed to (i) provide strong binding to workflow events and configurations, (ii) support constant-size storage and uniform verification cost per event, and (iii) compose cleanly with hash-chain and Merkle-based audit constructions. We formalize a simple model of regulated AI workflows, define syntax and algorithms for evidence structures, and articulate security goals such as audit integrity and non-equivocation. We present a generic hash-and-sign construction that instantiates this abstraction using a collision-resistant hash function and a standard digital signature scheme. We then show how to integrate the construction with hash-chained logs, Merkle-tree anchoring, and optionally trusted execution environments, and we analyze the asymptotic complexity of evidence generation and verification. Finally, we implement a prototype library and report microbenchmark results on commodity hardware, demonstrating that the per-event overhead of constant-size evidence is small and predictable.

While intrinsic reward methods have demonstrated effectiveness in single-agent rein-forcement learning scenarios, their application to multi-agent reinforcement learn-ing (MARL) remains problematic. The primary difficulties stem from two fac-tors: (1) the exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories that lead to rewards as the exploration space expands, and (2) existing methods often fail to account for joint actions that can influence team states. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards like episodic rewards. MIR incentivizes individual agents to explore actions that affect their teammates, and when combined with original strategies, effectively stimulates team exploration and improves algorithm performance. For comprehensive experimental valida-tion, we extend the representative single-agent MiniGrid environment to create MiniGrid-MA, a series of MARL environments with sparse rewards.

Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks.

When a tracker shuts down (whether by operator choice, technical failure, or legal action) users lose their contribution history and cannot prove their standing to new communities. We address these problems by storing reputation in smart contracts and replacing self-reports with cryptographic attestations. Receiving peers sign receipts for transferred pieces, which the tracker aggregates and verifies before updating on-chain reputation. Trackers run in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to guarantee correct aggregation and prevent manipulation of state. If a tracker is unavailable, peers use an authenticated Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for discovery: the on-chain reputation acts as a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), so peers can verify each other and maintain access control without the tracker. This design persists reputation across tracker failures and makes it portable to new instances through single-hop migration in factory-deployed contracts. We formalize the security requirements, prove correctness under standard cryptographic assumptions, and evaluate a prototype on Intel TDX. Measurements show that transfer receipts adds less than 6\\% overhead with typical piece sizes, and signature aggregation speeds up verification by $2.5\\times$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316BitTorrent\u4fe1\u8a89\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u79c1\u6709\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4fe1\u8a89\u65e0\u6cd5\u8de8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u8fc1\u79fb\u3001\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5355\u70b9\u6545\u969c\u3001\u4e0a\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u81ea\u62a5\u544a\u4e0d\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u79c1\u6709BitTorrent\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u8a89\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fc1\u79fb\u3001\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5355\u70b9\u6545\u969c\u548c\u81ea\u62a5\u544a\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f53\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u5173\u95ed\u65f6\u7528\u6237\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u8d21\u732e\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5411\u65b0\u793e\u533a\u8bc1\u660e\u4fe1\u8a89\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u5b58\u50a8\u4fe1\u8a89\uff0c\u7528\u52a0\u5bc6\u8bc1\u660e\u66ff\u4ee3\u81ea\u62a5\u544a\uff1b\u63a5\u6536\u65b9\u5bf9\u4f20\u8f93\u7247\u6bb5\u7b7e\u540d\uff0c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u5728\u53ef\u4fe1\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u805a\u5408\u9a8c\u8bc1\u540e\u66f4\u65b0\u94fe\u4e0a\u4fe1\u8a89\uff1b\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u54c8\u5e0c\u8868\u8fdb\u884c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u94fe\u4e0a\u4fe1\u8a89\u4f5c\u4e3a\u516c\u94a5\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728Intel TDX\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4f20\u8f93\u6536\u636e\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u4e0d\u52306%\u7684\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u7b7e\u540d\u805a\u5408\u4f7f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53472.5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u4e45\u4fdd\u5b58\u4fe1\u8a89\uff0c\u62b5\u5fa1\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5382\u90e8\u7f72\u5408\u7ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u8df3\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fe1\u8a89\u7684\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. Notably, shifts in the training data domain still cause even larger performance degradation, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. These results indicate that, in the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u5bf9LLM\u884c\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6cdb\u5316\u6210\u529f\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u6b3a\u9a97\u548c\u6545\u610f\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u76d1\u63a7\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u8bb8\u591aLLM\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u793a\u4f8b\u7a00\u5c11\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5408\u6210\u6216\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u7684LLM\u54cd\u5e94\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a2\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u63a2\u6d4b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u516b\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684LLM\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2aLLM\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u6210\u529f\u6cdb\u5316\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u6b3a\u9a97\u548c\u6545\u610f\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u53ef\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u57df\u7684\u504f\u79fb\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u57df\u7684\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u6bd4\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u57df\u7684\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5904\u7406LLM\u76d1\u63a7\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Encrypted FHIR resources are stored off-chain; a public blockchain records only cryptographic commitments and patient-signed, time-bounded permissions using EIP-712.

We formalize security goals (confidentiality, integrity, cryptographically attributable authorization, and auditability of authorization events) and provide a Solidity reference implementation deployed as single-patient contracts. On-chain costs for permission grants average 78,000 gas (L1), and end-to-end access latency for 1 MB records is 0.7--1.4s (mean values for S3 and IPFS respectively), dominated by storage retrieval. Layer-2 deployment reduces gas usage by 10--13x, though data availability charges dominate actual costs.

However, existing generic CP approaches need to transmit large volumes of perception data that are irrelevant to the driving safety, exceeding available communication bandwidth. Moreover, most CP frameworks rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments. This paper proposes a Spontaneous Risk-Aware Selective Cooperative Perception (SRA-CP) framework to address these challenges. SRA-CP introduces a decentralized protocol where connected agents continuously broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. A perceptual risk identification module enables each CV to locally assess the impact of occlusions on its driving task and determine whether cooperation is necessary. When CP is triggered, the ego vehicle selects appropriate peers based on shared perception coverage and engages in selective information exchange through a fusion module that prioritizes safety-critical content and adapts to bandwidth constraints. We evaluate SRA-CP on a public dataset against several representative baselines. Results show that SRA-CP achieves less than 1% average precision (AP) loss for safety-critical objects compared to generic CP, while using only 20% of the communication bandwidth. Moreover, it improves the perception performance by 15% over existing selective CP methods that do not incorporate risk awareness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSRA-CP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\u9700\u6c42", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f20\u8f93\u5927\u91cf\u4e0e\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8d85\u51fa\u53ef\u7528\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u4f19\u4f34\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u8f66\u8f86\u6301\u7eed\u5e7f\u64ad\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u611f\u77e5\u8986\u76d6\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u98ce\u9669\u76f8\u5173\u76f2\u533a\u65f6\u542f\u52a8\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u534f\u4f5c\uff1b\u5305\u542b\u611f\u77e5\u98ce\u9669\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u901a\u7528CP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cSRA-CP\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e0aAP\u635f\u5931\u5c0f\u4e8e1%\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752820%\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u6027CP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534715%", "conclusion": "SRA-CP\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u534f\u4f5c"}}
