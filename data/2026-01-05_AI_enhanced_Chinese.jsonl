Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) are conventionally suggested to overcome the read disturbance errors in STT-MRAM caches. By employing aggressive ECCs and checking out a cache block on every read access, a high level of cache reliability is achieved. However, to minimize the cache access time in modern processors, all blocks in the target cache set are simultaneously read in parallel for tags comparison operation and only the requested block is sent out, if any, after checking its ECC. These extra cache block reads without checking their ECCs until requesting the blocks by the processor cause the accumulation of read disturbance error, which significantly degrade the cache reliability. In this paper, we first introduce and formulate the read disturbance accumulation phenomenon and reveal that this accumulation due to conventional parallel accesses of cache blocks significantly increases the cache error rate. Then, we propose a simple yet effective scheme, so-called Read Error Accumulation Preventer cache (REAP-cache), to completely eliminate the accumulation of read disturbances without compromising the cache performance. Our evaluations show that the proposed REAP-cache extends the cache Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) by 171x, while increases the cache area by less than 1% and energy consumption by only 2.7%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faREAP-cache\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3STT-MRAM\u7f13\u5b58\u4e2d\u5e76\u884c\u8bfb\u53d6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bfb\u5e72\u6270\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7f13\u5b58\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "motivation": "STT-MRAM\u4f5c\u4e3aSRAM\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u7b49\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53d7\u5230\u9ad8\u8bfb\u5e72\u6270\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\u4f20\u7edfECC\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u5e76\u884c\u8bfb\u53d6\u7f13\u5b58\u5757\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u53ea\u68c0\u67e5\u8bf7\u6c42\u5757\u7684ECC\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u4ed6\u5e76\u884c\u8bfb\u53d6\u5757\u7684\u8bfb\u5e72\u6270\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u964d\u4f4e\u7f13\u5b58\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5f15\u5165\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bfb\u5e72\u6270\u7d2f\u79ef\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u5e76\u884c\u8bbf\u95ee\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51faREAP-cache\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u673a\u5236\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u8bfb\u5e72\u6270\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u7f13\u5b58\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aREAP-cache\u5c06\u7f13\u5b58\u5e73\u5747\u6545\u969c\u65f6\u95f4\uff08MTTF\uff09\u63d0\u5347171\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7f13\u5b58\u9762\u79ef\u589e\u52a0\u5c0f\u4e8e1%\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u4ec5\u589e\u52a02.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "REAP-cache\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3STT-MRAM\u7f13\u5b58\u4e2d\u7684\u8bfb\u5e72\u6270\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786c\u4ef6\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u589e\u52a0\u6781\u5c0f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, a significant challenge remains in effectively integrating both retrieval and reasoning strategies to optimize LLM performance. In this paper, we introduce a reasoning-aware knowledge retrieval method that enriches LLMs with information aligned to the logical structure of conversations, moving beyond surface-level semantic similarity. We follow a coarse-to-fine approach for knowledge retrieval. First, we identify a contextually relevant sub-region of the knowledge base, ensuring that all sentences within it are relevant to the context topic. Next, we refine our search within this sub-region to extract knowledge that is specifically relevant to the reasoning process. Throughout both phases, we employ the Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired search method to effectively navigate through knowledge sentences using common keywords.

Traditional tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were validated in high-income countries but may be linguistically or culturally inaccessible for low- and middle-income countries and communities such as Nigeria where people communicate in Nigerian Pidgin and more than 520 local languages. This study presents a novel approach to automated depression screening using fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) adapted for conversational Nigerian Pidgin. We collected a dataset of 432 Pidgin-language audio responses from Nigerian young adults aged 18-40 to prompts assessing psychological experiences aligned with PHQ-9 items, performed transcription, rigorous preprocessing and annotation, including semantic labeling, slang and idiom interpretation, and PHQ-9 severity scoring. Three LLMs - Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, Gemma-3-4B-it, and GPT-4.1 - were fine-tuned on this annotated dataset, and their performance was evaluated quantitatively (accuracy, precision and semantic alignment) and qualitatively (clarity, relevance, and cultural appropriateness). GPT-4.1 achieved the highest quantitative performance, with 94.5% accuracy in PHQ-9 severity scoring prediction, outperforming Gemma-3-4B-it and Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct. Qualitatively, GPT-4.1 also produced the most culturally appropriate, clear, and contextually relevant responses. AI-mediated depression screening for underserved Nigerian communities.

Discrete-event simulators are faster and cheaper, but they require re-implementing the serving system's control logic -- a burden that compounds as frameworks evolve.\n  We present Revati, a time-warp emulator that enables performance modeling by directly executing real serving system code at simulation-like speed. The system intercepts CUDA API calls to virtualize device management, allowing serving frameworks to run without physical GPUs. Instead of executing GPU kernels, it performs time jumps -- fast-forwarding virtual time by predicted kernel durations. We propose a coordination protocol that synchronizes these jumps across distributed processes while preserving causality. On vLLM and SGLang, Revati achieves less than 5% prediction error across multiple models and parallelism configurations, while running 5-17x faster than real GPU execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "Revati\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u626d\u66f2\u4eff\u771f\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u6267\u884c\u771f\u5b9e\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7269\u7406GPU\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u771f\u5b9eGPU\u6267\u884c\u5feb5-17\u500d", "motivation": "LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u767e\u79cd\u670d\u52a1\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728GPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u914d\u7f6e\u9700\u8981\u6570\u5c0f\u65f6\u548c\u6570\u5343\u7f8e\u5143\u6210\u672c\u3002\u79bb\u6563\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u867d\u7136\u66f4\u5feb\u66f4\u4fbf\u5b9c\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u6846\u67b6\u6f14\u8fdb\u8d1f\u62c5\u52a0\u91cd", "method": "Revati\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u626d\u66f2\u4eff\u771f\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62e6\u622aCUDA API\u8c03\u7528\u6765\u865a\u62df\u5316\u8bbe\u5907\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u670d\u52a1\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u7269\u7406GPU\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u6267\u884cGPU\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u8df3\u8dc3\u2014\u2014\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5185\u6838\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u8fdb\u865a\u62df\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u534f\u8c03\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8fdb\u7a0b\u4e2d\u540c\u6b65\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65f6\u95f4\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb", "result": "\u5728vLLM\u548cSGLang\u4e0a\uff0cRevati\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5c0f\u4e8e5%\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u771f\u5b9eGPU\u6267\u884c\u5feb5-17\u500d", "conclusion": "Revati\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u6267\u884c\u771f\u5b9e\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u670d\u52a1\u914d\u7f6e\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u5de5\u5177"}}

This paper presents a systematic, repeatable comparison of POS workload deployments on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure using real-time API endpoints and open-source benchmarking code. Using free-tier cloud resources, we offer a transparent methodology for POS workload evaluation that small retailers and researchers can use. Our approach measures important performance metrics like response latency, throughput, and scalability while estimating operational costs based on actual resource usage and current public cloud pricing because there is no direct billing under free-tier usage. All the tables and figures in this study are generated directly from code outputs, ensuring that the experimental data and the reported results are consistent.

In this context, traditional methods of assigning package deliveries to workers based on geographical proximity can be inefficient and surely guide to an unbalanced workload distribution among delivery workers. In this paper, we look at the problem of operational human resources workload balancing in last-mile urban package delivery systems. The idea is to consider the effort workload to optimize the system, i.e., the optimization process is now focused on improving the delivery time, so that the workload balancing is complete among all the staff. This process should correct significant decompensations in workload among delivery workers in a given zone. Specifically, we propose a multi-algorithm approach to tackle this problem. The proposed approach takes as input a set of delivery points and a defined number of workers, and then assigns packages to workers, in such a way that it ensures that each worker completes a similar amount of work per day. The proposed algorithms use a combination of distance and workload considerations to optimize the allocation of packages to workers. In this sense, the distance between the delivery points and the location of each worker is also taken into account. The proposed multi-algorithm methodology includes different versions of k-means, evolutionary approaches, recursive assignments based on k-means initialization with different problem encodings, and a hybrid evolutionary ensemble algorithm. We have illustrated the performance of the proposed approach in a real-world problem in an urban last-mile package delivery workforce operating at Azuqueca de Henares, Spain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u7b97\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u516c\u91cc\u5305\u88f9\u914d\u9001\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u8003\u8651\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5305\u88f9\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6bcf\u4f4d\u914d\u9001\u5458\u6bcf\u5929\u5b8c\u6210\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u7406\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u7684\u5305\u88f9\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u914d\u9001\u5458\u4e4b\u95f4\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u3002\u5728\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u516c\u91cc\u57ce\u5e02\u5305\u88f9\u914d\u9001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6240\u6709\u5458\u5de5\u5b8c\u6210\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u7ea0\u6b63\u533a\u57df\u5185\u914d\u9001\u5458\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u7b97\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u540c\u7248\u672c\u7684k-means\u3001\u8fdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u57fa\u4e8ek-means\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u5206\u914d\uff08\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u6df7\u5408\u8fdb\u5316\u96c6\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u914d\u9001\u70b9\u96c6\u5408\u548c\u5de5\u4eba\u6570\u91cf\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u8003\u8651\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5305\u88f9\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u897f\u73ed\u7259Azuqueca de Henares\u57ce\u5e02\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u516c\u91cc\u5305\u88f9\u914d\u9001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u914d\u9001\u5458\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7b97\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u516c\u91cc\u5305\u88f9\u914d\u9001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u914d\u9001\u5458\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7ea0\u6b63\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Although edge-cloud collaborative inference with speculative decoding (SD) can reduce end-to-end latency by executing a lightweight draft model at the edge and verifying it with a cloud-side target model, existing frameworks fundamentally rely on tight coupling between the two models. Consequently, repeated model synchronization introduces excessive communication overhead, increasing end-to-end latency, and ultimately limiting the scalability of SD in edge environments. To address these limitations, we propose FlexSpec, a communication-efficient collaborative inference framework tailored for evolving edge-cloud systems. The core design of FlexSpec is a shared-backbone architecture that allows a single and static edge-side draft model to remain compatible with a large family of evolving cloud-side target models. By decoupling edge deployment from cloud-side model updates, FlexSpec eliminates the need for edge-side retraining or repeated model downloads, substantially reducing communication and maintenance costs. Furthermore, to accommodate time-varying wireless conditions and heterogeneous device constraints, we develop a channel-aware adaptive speculation mechanism that dynamically adjusts the speculative draft length based on real-time channel state information and device energy budgets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexSpec achieves superior performance compared to conventional SD approaches in terms of inference efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlexSpec\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u4e3b\u5e72\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8026\u5408\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u3001\u65e0\u7ebf\u5e26\u5bbd\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9891\u7e41\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u540c\u6b65\u5e26\u6765\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "FlexSpec\u91c7\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u4e3b\u5e72\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u5355\u4e2a\u9759\u6001\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u4fa7\u8349\u7a3f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u4e91\u7aef\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u6301\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u8026\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0e\u4e91\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4fe1\u9053\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5b9e\u65f6\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u80fd\u91cf\u9884\u7b97\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63a8\u6d4b\u8349\u7a3f\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFlexSpec\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8fb9\u7f18\u4fa7\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u91cd\u590d\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u8f7d\u3002", "conclusion": "FlexSpec\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8fb9\u7f18\u4e0e\u4e91\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u6f14\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u4fe1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

AEs are minimally perturbed input data undetectable to humans posing significant risks to security-dependent applications. Hence, extensive research has been undertaken to develop defense mechanisms that mitigate their threats. Most existing methods primarily focus on discriminating AEs based on the input sample features, emphasizing AE detection without addressing the correct sample categorization before an attack. While some tasks may only require mere rejection on detected AEs, others necessitate identifying the correct original input category such as traffic sign recognition in autonomous driving. The objective of this study is to propose a method for rectifying AEs to estimate the correct labels of their original inputs. Our method is based on re-attacking AEs to move them beyond the decision boundary for accurate label prediction, effectively addressing the issue of rectifying minimally perceptible AEs created using white-box attack methods. However, challenge remains with respect to effectively rectifying AEs produced by black-box attacks at a distance from the boundary, or those misclassified into low-confidence categories by targeted attacks. By adopting a straightforward approach of only considering AEs as inputs, the proposed method can address diverse attacks while avoiding the requirement of parameter adjustments or preliminary training. Results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits consistent performance in rectifying AEs generated via various attack methods, including targeted and black-box attacks. Moreover, it outperforms conventional rectification and input transformation methods in terms of stability against various attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u6765\u7ea0\u6b63\u5176\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u79fb\u51fa\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u6b63\u786e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u6216\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u653b\u51fb\u524d\u6b63\u786e\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u67d0\u4e9b\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u8bc6\u522b\u5176\u539f\u59cb\u6b63\u786e\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7ea0\u6b63\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u4ee5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5176\u539f\u59cb\u6b63\u786e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u91cd\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u79fb\u51fa\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u6807\u7b7e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4ee5\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u6216\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5404\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u767d\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u3001\u9ed1\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u5b9a\u5411\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ea0\u6b63\u5404\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5b9a\u5411\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7ea0\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7ea0\u6b63\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5176\u539f\u59cb\u6b63\u786e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u68c0\u6d4b\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u6b63\u786e\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We design a computationally efficient algorithm derived from the MinScore algorithm, leveraging dynamic pruning and pattern caching to exactly calculate this metric during play. Opponent hand-modeling is also incorporated within a two-player zero-sum simulation framework, and the resulting strategies are evaluated using statistical hypothesis testing.

Although the fact that RAFT is well known for its simplicity, reliability, and efficiency, its security properties are not fully recognized, leaving implementations vulnerable to different kinds of attacks and threats, which can transform the RAFT harmony of consensus into a chaos of data inconsistency. This paper presents a systematic security analysis of the RAFT protocol, with a specific focus on its susceptibility to security threats such as message replay attacks and message forgery attacks. Examined how a malicious actor can exploit the protocol's message-passing mechanism to reintroduce old messages, disrupting the consensus process and leading to data inconsistency.

Inspired by these capabilities, this paper introduces ReCiSt, a bio-inspired agentic self-healing framework designed to achieve resilience in Distributed Computing Continuum Systems (DCCS). Modern DCCS integrate heterogeneous computing resources, ranging from resource-constrained IoT devices to high-performance cloud infrastructures, and their inherent complexity, mobility, and dynamic operating conditions expose them to frequent faults that disrupt service continuity. These challenges underscore the need for scalable, adaptive, and self-regulated resilience strategies. ReCiSt reconstructs the biological phases of Hemostasis, Inflammation, Proliferation, and Remodeling into the computational layers Containment, Diagnosis, Meta-Cognitive, and Knowledge for DCCS. These four layers perform autonomous fault isolation, causal diagnosis, adaptive recovery, and long-term knowledge consolidation through Language Model (LM)-powered agents. These agents interpret heterogeneous logs, infer root causes, refine reasoning pathways, and reconfigure resources with minimal human intervention. The proposed ReCiSt framework is evaluated on public fault datasets using multiple LMs, and no baseline comparison is included due to the scarcity of similar approaches. Nevertheless, our results, evaluated under different LMs, confirm ReCiSt's self-healing capabilities within tens of seconds with minimum of 10% of agent CPU usage.

As these KGs often represent an organization's highly valuable intellectual property (IP), they face a significant risk of theft for private use. In this scenario, attackers operate in isolated environments. This private-use threat renders passive defenses like watermarking ineffective, as they require output access for detection. Simultaneously, the low-latency demands of GraphRAG make strong encryption which incurs prohibitive overhead impractical. To address these challenges, we propose AURA, a novel framework based on Data Adulteration designed to make any stolen KG unusable to an adversary. Our framework pre-emptively injects plausible but false adulterants into the KG. For an attacker, these adulterants deteriorate the retrieved context and lead to factually incorrect responses. Conversely, for authorized users, a secret key enables the efficient filtering of all adulterants via encrypted metadata tags before they are passed to the LLM, ensuring query results remain completely accurate. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach: AURA degrades the performance of unauthorized systems to an accuracy of just 5.3%, while maintaining 100% fidelity for authorized users with negligible overhead.

The causal learning or extraction process is agentic both because of the LLM's semi-autonomy and because ultimately the FCM dynamical system's equilibria drive the LLM agents to fetch and process causal text. The fetched text can in principle modify the adaptive FCM causal structure and so modify the source of its quasi-autonomy--its equilibrium limit cycles and fixed-point attractors. This bidirectional process endows the evolving FCM dynamical system with a degree of autonomy while still staying on its agentic leash. We show in particular that a sequence of three finely tuned system instructions guide an LLM agent as it systematically extracts key nouns and noun phrases from text, as it extracts FCM concept nodes from among those nouns and noun phrases, and then as it extracts or infers partial or fuzzy causal edges between those FCM nodes. We test this FCM generation on a recent essay about the promise of AI from the late diplomat and political theorist Henry Kissinger and his colleagues. This three-step process produced FCM dynamical systems that converged to the same equilibrium limit cycles as did the human-generated FCMs even though the human-generated FCM differed in the number of nodes and edges. A final FCM mixed generated FCMs from separate Gemini and ChatGPT LLM agents. The mixed FCM absorbed the equilibria of its dominant mixture component but also created new equilibria of its own to better approximate the underlying causal dynamical system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u56e0\u679c\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u7cca\u8ba4\u77e5\u56fe\uff08FCM\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7FCM\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u72b6\u6001\u9a71\u52a8LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u5904\u7406\u56e0\u679c\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0eFCM\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u6b65\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u4ee4\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u540d\u8bcd\u548c\u540d\u8bcd\u77ed\u8bed\uff1b2\uff09\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e9b\u540d\u8bcd\u548c\u77ed\u8bed\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6FCM\u6982\u5ff5\u8282\u70b9\uff1b3\uff09\u63a8\u65adFCM\u8282\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u56e0\u679c\u8fb9\u3002\u6700\u540e\u6df7\u5408\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u7684FCM\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a1\uff09\u4e09\u6b65\u8fc7\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u7684FCM\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u751f\u6210\u7684FCM\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u6781\u9650\u73af\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u8fb9\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\uff1b2\uff09\u6df7\u5408\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u7684FCM\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5438\u6536\u4e86\u4e3b\u8981\u6210\u5206\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8fd8\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e86\u5e95\u5c42\u56e0\u679c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u4f18\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6FCM\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u6df7\u5408\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684FCM\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u5e95\u5c42\u56e0\u679c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The framework enforces unanimous-release confidentiality through a dual-layer protection mechanism that combines per-client affine masking with priority-driven sequential consensus locking. Decentralized integrity is verified via step (sigma_S) and data (sigma_D) checksums, facilitating autonomous malicious deviation detection and atomic abort without requiring persistent coordination. The design supports scalar, vector, and matrix payloads with O(N*D) computation and communication complexity, optional edge-server offloading, and resistance to collusion under N-1 corruptions. Formal analysis proves correctness, Consensus-Dependent Integrity and Fairness (CDIF) with overwhelming-probability abort on deviation, and IND-CPA security assuming a pseudorandom function family. Empirical evaluations on MNIST-derived vectors demonstrate linear scalability up to N = 500 with sub-millisecond per-client computation times. The framework achieves 100% malicious deviation detection, exact data recovery, and three-to-four orders of magnitude lower FLOPs compared to MPC and HE baselines.

The mechanics are evaluated by composing complete games through a tree search procedure, where the resulting games are evaluated by their ability to preserve a skill-based ordering over players -- that is, whether stronger players consistently outperform weaker ones. We assess the mechanics based on their contribution towards the skill-based ordering score in the game.

This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can help bridge this gap. We show that employing LLMs as direct, end-to-end solvers incurs a significant \"hallucination tax\": a performance gap arising from the model's inability to perform grounded stochastic reasoning. To address this, we propose a hybrid agentic framework that strictly decouples semantic reasoning from mathematical calculation. In this architecture, the LLM functions as an intelligent interface, eliciting parameters from natural language and interpreting results while automatically calling rigorous algorithms to build the optimization engine.\n  To evaluate this interactive system against the ambiguity and inconsistency of real-world managerial dialogue, we introduce the Human Imitator, a fine-tuned \"digital twin\" of a boundedly rational manager that enables scalable, reproducible stress-testing. Our empirical analysis reveals that the hybrid agentic framework reduces total inventory costs by 32.1% relative to an interactive baseline using GPT-4o as an end-to-end solver. Moreover, we find that providing perfect ground-truth information alone is insufficient to improve GPT-4o's performance, confirming that the bottleneck is fundamentally computational rather than informational.

Authenticated Encryption (AE) is essential for ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. However, existing lightweight AE standards lack forward-security guarantees, compact tag aggregation, and offline-online (OO) optimizations required for modern high-throughput IoT pipelines.\n  We introduce Diamond, the first provable secure Forward-secure and Aggregate Authenticated Encryption (FAAE) framework that extends and generalizes prior FAAE constructions through a lightweight key evolution mechanism, an OO-optimized computation pipeline, and a set of performance-tiered instantiations tailored to heterogeneous IoT platforms. Diamond substantially reduces amortized offline preprocessing (up to 47%) and achieves up to an order-ofmagnitude reduction in end-to-end latency for large telemetry batches. Our comprehensive evaluation across 64-bit ARM Cortex-A72, 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4, and 8-bit AVR architectures confirms that Diamond consistently outperforms baseline FAAE variants and NIST lightweight AE candidates across authenticated encryption throughput and end-to-end verification latency while maintaining compact tag aggregation and strong breach resilience. We formally prove the security of Diamond and provide two concrete instantiations optimized for compliance and high efficiency.

We developed an automated pipeline by fine-tuning GPT-3.5-Turbo to build two models: the Classifier-Rationalizer-Categorizer and the Thematic Mapper. By leveraging dynamic few-shot prompting and the model's large context size, our pipeline achieved over 97% precision and recall, significantly outperforming keyword-based and classical ML methods. We applied our pipeline to 91K Amazon reviews about fitness trackers, smart speakers and cameras, over multiple years. We found that on average 5% contained S&P concerns, while security camera exhibited the highest prevalence at 10%. Our method detected significantly more S&P-relevant reviews than prior works: 15x more for fitness trackers, 29% more for smart speakers, and 70% more for cameras. Our longitudinal analysis reveals that concerns like surveillance and data control have persisted for years, suggesting limited industry progress. We demonstrate that across all device types, users consistently demand more precise control over what data is collected and shared. We uncover challenges in multi-user and multi-device interactions, identifying two previously unreported themes concerning inadequate controls for account separation and data access.

Exploring the Belief-Dependent Vulnerability", "comment": "16 pages", "summary": "LLM-empowered agents can exhibit not only demographic bias (e.g., gender, religion) but also intergroup bias triggered by minimal \"us\" versus \"them\" cues. When this intergroup boundary aligns with an agent-human divide, the risk shifts from disparities among human demographic groups to a more fundamental group-level asymmetry, i.e., humans as a whole may be treated as the outgroup by agents. To examine this possibility, we construct a controlled multi-agent social simulation based on allocation decisions under explicit payoff trade-offs and find that agents exhibit a consistent intergroup bias under minimal group cues. Although this bias is attenuated when some counterparts are framed as humans, we attribute the attenuation to an implicit human-norm script that favors humans yet activates only when the agent believes a real human is present. This belief dependence creates a new attack surface. We therefore introduce a Belief Poisoning Attack (BPA) that corrupts persistent identity beliefs to suppress the human-norm script and reactivate outgroup bias toward humans, instantiated as profile poisoning at initialization (BPA-PP) and memory poisoning via optimized belief-refinement suffixes injected into stored reflections (BPA-MP). Finally, we discuss practical mitigation strategies for hardening current agent frameworks against BPA, highlighting feasible interventions at profile and memory boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the existence of agent intergroup bias and the severity of BPA across settings. Our goal in identifying these vulnerabilities is to inform safer agent design, not to enable real-world exploitation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b58\u5728\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f1a\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u5f53\u8fd9\u79cd\u7fa4\u4f53\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53-\u4eba\u7c7b\u5212\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89c6\u4e3a\u5916\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u793e\u4f1a\u6a21\u62df\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u6765\u6291\u5236\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u811a\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u8fd9\u79cd\u7fa4\u4f53\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53-\u4eba\u7c7b\u5212\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89c6\u4e3a\u5916\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002\u8fd9\u6d89\u53ca\u5230\u4ece\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u504f\u89c1\u5411\u66f4\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u793e\u4f1a\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u660e\u786e\u6536\u76ca\u6743\u8861\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u914d\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65f6\u7684\u6863\u6848\u4e2d\u6bd2\u548c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7cbe\u70bc\u540e\u7f00\u6ce8\u5165\u5b58\u50a8\u53cd\u601d\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u6bd2\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u548cBPA\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u504f\u89c1\uff1b2\uff09\u5f53\u90e8\u5206\u5bf9\u5e94\u65b9\u88ab\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u4f1a\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u51cf\u5f31\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u76f8\u4fe1\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff1b3\uff09\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u811a\u672c\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u662fLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u786e\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u53ef\u80fd\u9488\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6863\u6848\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8fb9\u754c\u5b9e\u65bd\u5b9e\u9645\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5f3a\u5316\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5b9e\u73b0\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5229\u7528\u3002"}}

Under review", "summary": "Detecting coordinated inauthentic behavior on social media remains a critical and persistent challenge, as most existing approaches rely on superficial correlation analysis, employ static parameter settings, and demand extensive and labor-intensive manual annotation. To address these limitations systematically, we propose the Adaptive Causal Coordination Detection (ACCD) framework. ACCD adopts a three-stage, progressive architecture that leverages a memory-guided adaptive mechanism to dynamically learn and retain optimal detection configurations for diverse coordination scenarios. Specifically, in the first stage, ACCD introduces an adaptive Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) technique to deeply identify genuine causal relationships between accounts. The second stage integrates active learning with uncertainty sampling within a semi-supervised classification scheme, significantly reducing the burden of manual labeling. The third stage deploys an automated validation module driven by historical detection experience, enabling self-verification and optimization of the detection outcomes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation using real-world datasets, including the Twitter IRA dataset, Reddit coordination traces, and several widely-adopted bot detection benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that ACCD achieves an F1-score of 87.3\\% in coordinated attack detection, representing a 15.2\\% improvement over the strongest existing baseline. Furthermore, the system reduces manual annotation requirements by 68\\% and achieves a 2.8x speedup in processing through hierarchical clustering optimization. In summary, ACCD provides a more accurate, efficient, and highly automated end-to-end solution for identifying coordinated behavior on social platforms, offering substantial practical value and promising potential for broad application.", "AI": {"tldr": "ACCD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5f15\u5bfc\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u865a\u5047\u884c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u865a\u5047\u884c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u9759\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3001\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56e0\u679c\u534f\u8c03\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08ACCD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6536\u655b\u4ea4\u53c9\u6620\u5c04\u6280\u672f\u8bc6\u522b\u8d26\u6237\u95f4\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2\uff09\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u679c\u81ea\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08Twitter IRA\u3001Reddit\u534f\u8c03\u75d5\u8ff9\u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cACCD\u5728\u534f\u8c03\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523087.3%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534715.2%\uff1b\u51cf\u5c1168%\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b02.8\u500d\u5904\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "ACCD\u4e3a\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0\u534f\u8c03\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5b9e\u8df5\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

A Methodology for Football with Broader Applications", "comment": "Submitted to Sci (MDPI) for peer review", "summary": "This paper explores how semantic-space reasoning, traditionally used in computational linguistics, can be extended to tactical decision-making in team sports. Building on the analogy between texts and teams -- where players act as words and collective play conveys meaning -- the proposed methodology models tactical configurations as compositional semantic structures. Each player is represented as a multidimensional vector integrating technical, physical, and psychological attributes; team profiles are aggregated through contextual weighting into a higher-level semantic representation. Within this shared vector space, tactical templates such as high press, counterattack, or possession build-up are encoded analogously to linguistic concepts. Their alignment with team profiles is evaluated using vector-distance metrics, enabling the computation of tactical ``fit'' and opponent-exploitation potential. A Python-based prototype demonstrates how these methods can generate interpretable, dynamically adaptive strategy recommendations, accompanied by fine-grained diagnostic insights at the attribute level. Beyond football, the approach offers a generalizable framework for collective decision-making and performance optimization in team-based domains -- ranging from basketball and hockey to cooperative robotics and human-AI coordination systems.

Alalfi"], "title": "Cracking IoT Security: Can LLMs Outsmart Static Analysis Tools?", "comment": null, "summary": "Smart home IoT platforms such as openHAB rely on Trigger Action Condition (TAC) rules to automate device behavior, but the interplay among these rules can give rise to interaction threats, unintended or unsafe behaviors emerging from implicit dependencies, conflicting triggers, or overlapping conditions. Identifying these threats requires semantic understanding and structural reasoning that traditionally depend on symbolic, constraint-driven static analysis. This work presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) across a multi-category interaction threat taxonomy, assessing their performance on both the original openHAB (oHC/IoTB) dataset and a structurally challenging Mutation dataset designed to test robustness under rule transformations. We benchmark Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 70B, GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and DeepSeek-R1 across zero-, one-, and two-shot settings, comparing their results against oHIT's manually validated ground truth. Our findings show that while LLMs exhibit promising semantic understanding, particularly on action- and condition-related threats, their accuracy degrades significantly for threats requiring cross-rule structural reasoning, especially under mutated rule forms. Model performance varies widely across threat categories and prompt settings, with no model providing consistent reliability.

However, existing multimodal DPO approaches often suffer from overfitting due to the difficulty imbalance in preference data. Our analysis shows that MLLMs tend to overemphasize easily distinguishable preference pairs, which hinders fine-grained hallucination suppression and degrades overall performance. To address this issue, we propose Difficulty-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (DA-DPO), a cost-effective framework designed to balance the learning process. DA-DPO consists of two main components: (1) Difficulty Estimation leverages pre-trained vision--language models with complementary generative and contrastive objectives, whose outputs are integrated via a distribution-aware voting strategy to produce robust difficulty scores without additional training; and (2) Difficulty-Aware Training reweights preference pairs based on their estimated difficulty, down-weighting easy samples while emphasizing harder ones to alleviate overfitting. This framework enables more effective preference optimization by prioritizing challenging examples, without requiring new data or extra fine-tuning stages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DA-DPO consistently improves multimodal preference optimization, yielding stronger robustness to hallucinations and better generalization across standard benchmarks, while remaining computationally efficient.

However, when integrated with frameworks like FedIT, LoRA introduces a critical vulnerability: clients submit $A$ and $B$ matrices separately, while only their product $AB$ determines the model update, yet this composite is never directly verified. We propose Gradient Assembly Poisoning (GAP), a novel attack that exploits this blind spot by crafting individually benign $A$ and $B$ matrices whose product yields malicious updates. GAP operates without access to training data or inter-client coordination and remains undetected by standard anomaly detectors.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a shift from numerical pattern fitting to semantic, context-aware behavioral reasoning, yet existing LLM applications lack domain-specific adaptation and visual context. This study introduces Pedestrian Crossing LLM (PedX-LLM), a vision-and-knowledge enhanced framework designed to transform pedestrian crossing inference from site-specific pattern recognition to generalizable behavioral reasoning. By integrating LLaVA-extracted visual features with textual data and transportation domain knowledge, PedX-LLM fine-tunes a LLaMA-2-7B foundation model via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to infer crossing decisions. PedX-LLM achieves 82.0% balanced accuracy, outperforming the best statistical and supervised learning methods. Results demonstrate that the vision-augmented module contributes a 2.9% performance gain by capturing the built environment and integrating domain knowledge yields an additional 4.1% improvement. To evaluate generalizability across unseen environments, cross-site validation was conducted using site-based partitioning. The zero-shot PedX-LLM configuration achieves 66.9% balanced accuracy on five unseen test sites, outperforming the baseline data-driven methods by at least 18 percentage points. Incorporating just five validation examples via few-shot learning to PedX-LLM further elevates the balanced accuracy to 72.2%. PedX-LLM demonstrates strong generalizability to unseen scenarios, confirming that vision-and-knowledge-enhanced reasoning enables the model to mimic human-like decision logic and overcome the limitations of purely data-driven methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faPedX-LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5c06\u884c\u4eba\u8fc7\u8857\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u65ad\u4ece\u7ad9\u70b9\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u884c\u4eba\u8fc7\u8857\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPedX-LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528LLaVA\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7LoRA\u5bf9LLaMA-2-7B\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b4\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "PedX-LLM\u8fbe\u523082.0%\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u4f73\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u8d21\u732e2.9%\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u96c6\u6210\u5e26\u6765\u989d\u59164.1%\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u672a\u89c1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ad9\u70b9\u4e0a\uff0c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u914d\u7f6e\u8fbe\u523066.9%\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u4ec55\u4e2a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6837\u672c\uff09\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u81f372.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "PedX-LLM\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u884c\u4eba\u8fc7\u8857\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Despite prior research, most existing studies focus only on specific sub-components of ICVs due to their inherent complexity. As a result, there is a lack of systematic understanding of ICV vulnerabilities. Moreover, much of the current literature relies on human subjective analysis, such as surveys and interviews, which tends to be high-level and unvalidated, leaving a significant gap between theoretical findings and real-world attacks. To address this issue, we conducted the first large-scale empirical study on ICV vulnerabilities. We began by analyzing existing ICV security literature and summarizing the prevailing taxonomies in terms of vulnerability locations and types. To evaluate their real-world relevance, we collected a total of 649 exploitable vulnerabilities, including 592 from eight ICV vulnerability discovery competitions, Anonymous Cup, between January 2023 and April 2024, covering 48 different vehicles. The remaining 57 vulnerabilities were submitted daily by researchers. Based on this dataset, we assessed the coverage of existing taxonomies and identified several gaps, discovering one new vulnerability location and 13 new vulnerability types. We further categorized these vulnerabilities into 6 threat types (e.g., privacy data breach) and 4 risk levels (ranging from low to critical) and analyzed participants' skills and the types of ICVs involved in the competitions. This study provides a comprehensive and data-driven analysis of ICV vulnerabilities, offering actionable insights for researchers, industry practitioners, and policymakers. To support future research, we have made our vulnerability dataset publicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u7f51\u8054\u6c7d\u8f66\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u4e86649\u4e2a\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u7f51\u8054\u6c7d\u8f66\u5b89\u5168\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u591a\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u7279\u5b9a\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e3b\u89c2\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u653b\u51fb\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709ICV\u5b89\u5168\u6587\u732e\u603b\u7ed3\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u6536\u96c6649\u4e2a\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff08592\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea8\u6b21ICV\u6f0f\u6d1e\u53d1\u73b0\u7ade\u8d5b\uff0c57\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u65e5\u5e38\u63d0\u4ea4\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa1\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c13\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7c7b\u578b\uff1b\u5c06\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a6\u79cd\u5a01\u80c1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c4\u4e2a\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u7ea7\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7ade\u8d5b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u6d89\u53ca\u7684ICV\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9ICV\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u3001\u884c\u4e1a\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u516c\u5f00\u4e86\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}
