Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nrecently made significant progress in smart contract vulnerability detection.\nHowever, they still face challenges such as high inference costs and\nsubstantial computational overhead. In this paper, we propose ParaVul, a\nparallel LLM and retrieval-augmented framework to improve the reliability and\naccuracy of smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, we first\ndevelop Sparse Low-Rank Adaptation (SLoRA) for LLM fine-tuning. SLoRA\nintroduces sparsification by incorporating a sparse matrix into quantized\nLoRA-based LLMs, thereby reducing computational overhead and resource\nrequirements while enhancing their ability to understand vulnerability-related\nissues. We then construct a vulnerability contract dataset and develop a hybrid\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that integrates dense retrieval\nwith Best Matching 25 (BM25), assisting in verifying the results generated by\nthe LLM. Furthermore, we propose a meta-learning model to fuse the outputs of\nthe RAG system and the LLM, thereby generating the final detection results.\nAfter completing vulnerability detection, we design chain-of-thought prompts to\nguide LLMs to generate comprehensive vulnerability detection reports.\nSimulation results demonstrate the superiority of ParaVul, especially in terms\nof F1 scores, achieving 0.9398 for single-label detection and 0.9330 for\nmulti-label detection."}

We evaluate four models\n(ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek) across twelve prompting techniques to\ninterpret semi-structured and unstructured vulnerability information. As a\nconcrete use case, we test each model's ability to predict decision points in\nthe Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC) framework:\nExploitation, Automatable, Technical Impact, and Mission and Wellbeing.\n  Using 384 real-world vulnerabilities from the VulZoo dataset, we issued more\nthan 165,000 queries to assess performance under prompting styles including\none-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought. We report F1 scores for each SSVC\ndecision point and Cohen's kappa (weighted and unweighted) for the final SSVC\ndecision outcomes. Gemini consistently ranked highest, leading on three of four\ndecision points and yielding the most correct recommendations. Prompting with\nexemplars generally improved accuracy, although all models struggled on some\ndecision points. Only DeepSeek achieved fair agreement under weighted metrics,\nand all models tended to over-predict risk.\n  Overall, current LLMs do not replace expert judgment.

Therefore, we propose ShortcutBreaker, a novel unified\nfeature-reconstruction framework for MUAD tasks, featuring two key innovations\nto address the issue of shortcuts. First, drawing on matrix rank inequality, we\ndesign a low-rank noisy bottleneck (LRNB) to project highdimensional features\ninto a low-rank latent space, and theoretically demonstrate its capacity to\nprevent trivial identity reproduction. Second, leveraging ViTs global modeling\ncapability instead of merely focusing on local features, we incorporate a\nglobal perturbation attention to prevent information shortcuts in the decoders.\nExtensive experiments are performed on four widely used anomaly detection\nbenchmarks, including three industrial datasets (MVTec-AD, ViSA, and Real-IAD)\nand one medical dataset (Universal Medical).

To investigate this paradox, we\nconstruct a scenario-game dataset spanning 3 macro scenes and 19 sub-scenes,\nand run extensive closed-loop interactions with trust explicitly parameterized.\nUsing Minimum Necessary Information (MNI) as the safety baseline, we propose\ntwo unified metrics: Over-Exposure Rate (OER) to detect boundary violations,\nand Authorization Drift (AD) to capture sensitivity to trust levels.

Fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive electronic\nhealth record (EHR) data improves domain alignment but also raises the risk of\nexposing patient information through model behaviors. In this work-in-progress,\nwe present an exploratory empirical study on membership inference\nvulnerabilities in clinical LLMs, focusing on whether adversaries can infer if\nspecific patient records were used during model training. Using a\nstate-of-the-art clinical question-answering model, Llemr, we evaluate both\ncanonical loss-based attacks and a domain-motivated paraphrasing-based\nperturbation strategy that more realistically reflects clinical adversarial\nconditions. Our preliminary findings reveal limited but measurable membership\nleakage, suggesting that current clinical LLMs provide partial resistance yet\nremain susceptible to subtle privacy risks that could undermine trust in\nclinical AI adoption. These results motivate continued development of\ncontext-aware, domain-specific privacy evaluations and defenses such as\ndifferential privacy fine-tuning and paraphrase-aware training, to strengthen\nthe security and trustworthiness of healthcare AI systems."}

We investigate IntlS' exposure and\ninteractions with scams, post-exposure actions such as reporting, and their\nperceptions of the usefulness of existing prevention resources and the barriers\nto following prevention advice. We find that IntlS are often targeted by scams\n(e.g., attackers impersonating government officials) and fear legal\nimplications or deportation, which directly impacts their interactions with\nscams (e.g., they may prolong engagement with a scammer due to a sense of\nurgency).

We conducted a comprehensive comparative evaluation of three\ntopic modelling approaches: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Structural Topic\nModelling (STM), and BERTopic. We also introduced a novel algorithm, named\nCOFFEE, designed to enable robust covariate effect estimation for BERTopic.\nThis advancement addresses a significant gap, as BERTopic lacks a native\nfunction for covariate analysis, unlike the probabilistic STM.

To reduce output drift and\nsupport measurement, the model is constrained to produce structured,\ngrammar-valid responses, and a single decision threshold is calibrated on a\nsmall development split. We compare zero-shot, instruction-guided, and few-shot\nprompting to strong tabular and neural baselines under identical splits,\nreporting accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and macro scores. Empirically,\nunguided prompting is unreliable, while instructions plus flags substantially\nimprove detection quality; adding calibrated scoring further stabilizes\nresults. On a balanced subset of two hundred flows, a 7B instruction-tuned\nmodel with flags reaches macro-F1 near 0.78; a lighter 3B model with few-shot\ncues and calibration attains F1 near 0.68 on one thousand examples.

BreakFun employs a\nthree-part prompt that combines an innocent framing and a Chain-of-Thought\ndistraction with a core \"Trojan Schema\"--a carefully crafted data structure\nthat compels the model to generate harmful content, exploiting the LLM's strong\ntendency to follow structures and schemas.
