Prior work has focused on\nlargely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple\nmechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging\nsetting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only\n\"one life\" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We\nintroduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through\nconditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming\nframework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,\nactivating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph\nthat routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding\nscaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,\nhierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with\nsparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding\nconstraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state\nranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible\nones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that\nclosely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,\nour reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,\nobject-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on\nthat state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from\nminimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23\nscenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated\nrollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a\nfoundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,\ncomplex environments."}

We\npropose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages\nits working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a\nunified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement\nlearning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under\ngiven resource constraints.
